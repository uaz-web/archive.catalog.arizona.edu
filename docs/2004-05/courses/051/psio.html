<!--PSIO195A start--><p><b><a name="PSIO195A" >PSIO 195A</a>
 -- How the Body Works
 </b>&nbsp;(1 unit)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This course will consist of informal lectures and discussions on the function of the body. By examining how the body responds during a coordinated activity, namely muscular exercise, students will develop an understanding of basic functions of the major organs of the body. The discussions will take place both in the classroom, and via a "computer Enhanced Learning Linkage" (CELL). Students will learn how to use CELL to interact with faculty members and with each other, and to gain access to an information repository. One goal will be for students to use
 CELL to select a faculty member and arrange a visit to the faculty laboratory. Each student will then deposit a report of their visit on CELL to share with the other students.&nbsp; This is a <a href="../../policies/crsnum.htm#first">First-Year Colloquium Course</a>.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular or alternative grades</a> can be awarded for this course: A B C D E or S P C D E.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall.<!--PSIO195A ends-->
