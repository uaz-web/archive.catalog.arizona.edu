<DIR><B><P>Connections: A Study of Science, Technology and Innovation</b> Basic aspects of physics, chemistry, and astronomy are integrated to show how technology evolves from science, interconnecting events, and accidents of time. Who would have imagined that modern communications, movies, printing presses, and computers have their roots in the stirrup, cannon, 12th century underwear, and the water wheel. We explore the science and technology that has given us today's society and examine opportunities for today and the future.

<B><P>Basic Concepts in Water-Related Applications</b> This course develops an understanding of natural science concepts and ideas and how they can be used to understand and analyze processes and objects in the every day world.

Within each major focus area we shall explore how change has and is occurring at the local, regional and global scales. To facilitate the learning process we shall analyze local, national and international case histories. The case histories would include air pollution at the Grand Canyon, TCE groundwater contamination in Tucson, landfill and leaking underground storage tanks in Tucson, Chernobyl, and the Mt. Graham controversy.

<B><P>Introduction to Global Change</b> The basics of physical science are presented within the context of global environmental change processes (climatic change, global warming, deforestation, etc.) that impact Earth and its inhabitants.

<B><P>The World Around Us</b> This is a course inquiring into basic concepts used by every physical
science in its exploration of the world. The concepts originate in physics, which offers the framework on which other disciplines are
build. Applications of the concepts are made in the course, not just to traditional physics problems, but to problems in many other scientific disciplines. In the course we will explore the development of the concepts from their intuitive beginnings to their present forms. In the process, we will see how science searches for a logically consistent explanation of the world, and how the creation of these concepts has influenced our perception of that world. 

<B><P>Introduction to Weather and Climate</b> An introduction to the science of weather processes and climate, including the genesis of fronts and cyclones, precipitation processes, the wind systems of the world, severe storms, and weather forecasting.

The course will discuss many sorts of natural clocks, both cyclic (atoms, planet orbits, neutron stars) and non-cyclic growth and decay (chemical and nuclear reactions, radioactivity, geological processes, the birth and death of stars), and the time scales on which each can be used. We will see how a few central principles keep recurring in our attempt to understand the working of these clocks. Ultimately, we will discuss how Einstein had to change our ideas about time measurement in order to accommodate these principles, and how the accommodation has lead to our present view of the universe.

<B><P>The Universe and Humanity: Origin and Destiny</b> This course explores the deep relationships that connect the largest structures in the universe to the world of atoms and subatomic particles. Topics covered begin with the scientific method and tools of science, proceed to fundamental physical concepts and processes that govern the natural world, and move on to a study of features of the natural world based upon fundamental laws of nature. This knowledge is used to create a broad perspective for understanding the origin and evolution of our Milky Way Galaxy, our Solar System, and their common cosmic heritage.
<B><P>The Concepts of Physical Science</b> This is a course inquiring into basic concepts used by every physical science in its exploration of the world.

This is accomplished through studying the major components that effect architecture: region, culture, and technology. the course follows these factors through the history of western civilization, from ancient Greece to contemporary Europe and America. Greater emphasis is given to the contemporary period because radical changes in technology and resources make this information more pertinent to the present.

<B><P>Science and Inquiry</b> The effects of modern science on western civilization have been profound. A moment's thought will reveal applications of science that have transformed our way of life. But aside from its practical benefits (and costs!), modern science has had an equally profound intellectual impact. An educated man or woman at the close of the twentieth century has a vastly different view of the world, and of the power of science to reveal that world, from the views of Aristotle, of Dante or even of Newton. This transformation has been brought about in large part by the development of scientific thought. In this course we shall examine the distinctive features of scientific inquiry. We shall aim to understand the power and also the limitations of scientific methods.
