 The Clinical Practice of Telemedicine
 </b> (3-6)  The goal of this elective is to introduce the student to the practice of telemedicine. Telemedicine allows for patient evaluation at a distance. By allowing the patient to remain in her/his own community, telemedicine is thought to increase access to care. Although the main focus of this elective is clinical, students interest in technology assessment, economic evaluation and patient education are encouraged. Placements at rural sites are available.

 Introduction to Dermatopathology
