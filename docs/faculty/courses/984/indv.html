    <dir>

      framework for discussion about landscape design as a comprehensive art form and dialog
      between man and nature.</p>
      <b><p>Black and White: The Causes and Consequences. </b>Race remains, as Thomas Jefferson
      feared and Alexis de Tocqueville predicted, the most incendiary and intractable issue in
      American politics. It was a divisive issue when the Constitution was drafted in 1787; it
      was the central issue in a series of compromises that ultimately failed to hold the nation
      together in 1860; it was the most visible issue in both the Civil War and the worst riots
      in the nation's history that followed in the present century. In his Second Inaugural
      speech on January 20, 1997, President Bill Clinton correctly described racism as America's
      &quot;constant curse.&quot; The purpose of this course is to identify and explain why this
      is so.</p>
      <b><p>Business in Modern Society.</b> This course examines the place of business in the

      society's members to claim a share of its wealth in order to partake of that standard of
