<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>[Rpt.]</strong></font> May be repeated for credit. A
restriction regarding the number of times a course may be repeated for credit (beyond the
student's first enrollment) or the total number of units of credit permitted for a course
may be designated. [Rpt.] indicates that the course may be repeated for credit once, for a
total of two enrollments. [Rpt./2] indicates that the course may be repeated for credit
twice, for a maximum of three enrollments in the course; [Rpt./6 units] means that the
course may be repeated until the student has received a total of 6 units of credit.
[Rpt./] indicates that the course may repeated an unlimited number of times;
students should consult with department for details and possible restrictions.<font color="#BA0113">
</font>It is
the student's responsibility to ensure that course content is not duplicated.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#0000A0">I </font></strong>Semester in which a course is usually
offered. I indicates fall semester; II, spring; and S, summer. If no semester designation
is present, the course is usually offered each term. Courses are sometimes offered during
a term other than that indicated in the catalog; for offerings in a particular term,
consult the <strong><em><a href="https://uaccess.schedule.arizona.edu/psp/uazsaprd2/UA_SCHEDULE/HRMS/h/?tab=DEFAULT">Schedule of Classes</a> </em></strong>for
that term.</p>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>1991-92</strong> </font>Year in which a course is

indicate &quot;recitation&quot;, &quot;laboratory&quot;, &quot;studio&quot;, and
&quot;discussion&quot;. 2R, 3L indicates that the class meets for two hours of recitation
and three hours of laboratory per week (based upon 15 weeks). For courses consisting of
recitation (lecture) periods only, the number of class hours per week is the same as the
unit value and is not specified in the course listing.</p>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>ED, ES</strong></font> In addition to the above
abbreviations for class structure, the College of Engineering and Mines uses the
abbreviations ED and ES to designate the number of units in the areas of &quot;engineering
design&quot; and &quot;engineering science&quot;. Thus 1ED, 2ES signifies that the course
meets the requirement for 1 unit of engineering design and 2 units of engineering science.</p>

which do not have course descriptions.</p>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>May be convened with 506</strong></font> Certain 400- and
500-level courses with the same number and title may be convened jointly. Students may
receive credit for such courses only once, whether jointly convened or separately, unless
designated [Rpt.] or unless special approval is granted by the student's major advisor.
The 500-level listing designates additional requirements for graduate credit.</p>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>Writing Emphasis Course </strong></font>Every
undergraduate degree program includes at least one required writing-emphasis course.
Writing-emphasis courses are regular junior- or senior-level courses in an academic
discipline in which at least half the grade awarded is determined by written work
appropriate to the academic discipline. Such courses are identified with the phrase
&quot;Writing Emphasis Course&quot; at the end of the course description listed in the
catalog. Prerequisite to a writing-emphasis course is a satisfactory performance on the
UDWPE or, for those students whose UDWPE is evaluated as unsatisfactory, further
developmental work in writing. For more information about upper-division writing
requirements, see&nbsp; <a href="../../../policies/984/udwpe.htm">http://catalog.arizona.edu/policies/984/udwpe.htm</a>

<h3>Course Numbering Classification System</h3>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>Semester Courses</strong></font> (Single Numbers) <br>
A course designated by a single number (as ECON 248) is one semester in length. </p>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>Year Courses</strong></font> (Double Numbers) <br>
A course designated by a double number (as POL 233a-233b) is continued through two
successive semesters, the work of the first semester being prerequisite to that of the
second unless otherwise indicated in the statement of prerequisites. </p>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>Course level</strong></font> <br>
The number by which a course is designated indicates the level of the course. Courses are
numbered as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>100-299: Lower-division courses primarily for freshmen and sophomores.</p>
  <p>100-199: Primarily introductory and beginning courses. </p>
  <p>200-299: Intermediate-level courses. </p>
  <p>300-499: Upper-division courses primarily for juniors and seniors. </p>
  <p>300-399: Advanced-intermediate-level courses. </p>
  <p>400-499: Advanced-level courses.*</p>
  <p>500-599: Graduate courses. Open to exceptionally well-qualified seniors with the prior
  written approval of the course instructor and the Graduate College.*</p>
  <p>600-699: Graduate courses. Not open to undergraduate students.</p>
  <p>700-799: Graduate courses limited to doctoral students.</p>
  <p>800-899: Courses limited to students working toward degrees offered by the College of
  Medicine or the College of Pharmacy. Not available for credit toward other degrees.</p>
  <p>900-999: Independent graduate study involving research, thesis, or dissertation. Not
  open to undergraduates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>*Certain 400- and 500-level courses with the same number and title may be convened
jointly. Students may receive credit for such courses only once, whether jointly convened
or separately, unless designated [Rpt.] or unless special approval is granted by the
student's major advisor. </p>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>University-wide House Numbered Courses<br>
</strong></font>Most University of Arizona courses use a combination of lectures,
discussions, and laboratories as their basic teaching format. University-wide
&quot;house&quot; numbers identify three categories of courses using alternative teaching
formats: 

<ol>
  <li>Courses which designate <a href="crsdesc.htm#Senior research">special senior-level undergraduate
    research or projects</a>, </li>
  <li>Courses offered in <a href="crsdesc.htm#Small group courses">small group</a> settings, and </li>
  <li>Courses taught on an <a href="crsdesc.htm#Individual-studies courses">individual</a> basis.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li><font color="#0000A0"><strong><a name="Senior research">Special senior-level
    undergraduate research or project course</a>s</strong></font> are identified (1) for
    students pursuing majors which require a synthesizing project or paper as a part of
    completion of the major and (2) for thesis research and writing for students completing
    the Honors Program. These courses are designated as 498 and 498H respectively. <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>498. Senior Capstone</strong></font> (credit varies). A
      culminating experience for majors involving a substantive project that demonstrates a
      synthesis of learning accumulated in the major, including broadly comprehensive knowledge
      of the discipline and its methodologies. Senior standing required.</p>
      <p>Grades Available: A, B, C, D, E, I, P/F, S/P*, W. </p>
      <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>498H. Honors Thesis</strong></font> (3) [Rpt./6 units].
      An honors thesis is required of all the students graduating with honors. Students
      ordinarily sign up for this course as a two-semester sequence. The first semester the
      student performs research under the supervision of a faculty member; the second semester
      the student writes an honors thesis.</p>

      <p>Freshmen should note that courses numbered 195 are part of a special First Year
      Colloquium series, designed to give students insight into the concepts and practices which
      typify different academic disciplines. First-year colloquia introduce students to the
      methods and standards of the discipline for discovering new knowledge, the values which
      characterize the field of study, advances in the field, impact on society, and career
      opportunities.</p>
