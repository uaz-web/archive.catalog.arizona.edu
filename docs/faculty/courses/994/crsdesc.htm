<blockquote>
  <p>Course listings are subject to change without notice. Courses listed in the
  General Catalog are approved to be taught for the specified term, and are not
  a reflection of what will actually be offered for that term.&nbsp; For course
  offerings/availability by term, see the <a href="https://uaccess.schedule.arizona.edu/psp/uazsaprd2/UA_SCHEDULE/HRMS/h/?tab=DEFAULT">Schedule
  of Classes</a>.&nbsp; Each course number links to the Schedule of Classes.</p>
  <p>Students must meet the course <strong>prerequisites</strong> or otherwise
  satisfy the instructor of his or her preparation to take the course.
  Prerequisites can be waived only at the discretion of the instructor or
  department offering the course.</p>
  <h3><small>Sample Course Description:</small></h3>
  <p>Following is a standard, dummy course description with the individual
  elements explained in the order in which they appear in the description.&nbsp;
  <font size="3">Each c</font>ourse will not necessarily have <strong>all</strong>
  of these elements.</p>
  <p><font color="#333399"><strong><u>SOC 406</u> Social Structure in Modern
  Societies</strong> (3) [Rpt.] I GRD Critical review of modern theory and
  research on social structure and social organization in modern societies. 2R,
  3L. P, 6 units of sociology or CR. (Identical with HIST 406.) May be convened

  <h4>Explanations:</h4>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong><u>SOC 406</u></strong></font> Course
  number.&nbsp; Course numbers link to the <a href="https://uaccess.schedule.arizona.edu/psp/uazsaprd2/UA_SCHEDULE/HRMS/h/?tab=DEFAULT">Schedule
  of Classes</a>.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>Social Structure in Modern Societies</strong></font>
  Course title.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>(3)</strong></font> Number of units.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>[Rpt.]</strong></font> May be repeated for
  credit. A restriction regarding the number of times a course may be repeated
  for credit (beyond the student's first enrollment) or the total number of
  units of credit permitted for a course may be designated. [Rpt.] indicates
  that the course may be repeated for credit once, for a total of two
  enrollments. [Rpt./2] indicates that the course may be repeated for credit
  twice, for a maximum of three enrollments in the course; [Rpt./6 units] means
  that the course may be repeated until the student has received a total of 6
  units of credit. [Rpt./] indicates that the course may repeated an unlimited
  number of times; students should consult with department for details and
  possible restrictions.<font color="#ba0113"> </font>It is the student's
  responsibility to ensure that course content is not duplicated.</p>
  <p><strong><font color="#0000A0">I </font></strong>Semester in which a course
  is usually offered. I indicates Fall semester; II, Spring; and S, Summer. If
  no semester designation is present, the course is usually offered each term.
  Courses are sometimes offered during a term other than that indicated in the
  Catalog; for offerings in a particular term, consult the <em><a href="https://uaccess.schedule.arizona.edu/psp/uazsaprd2/UA_SCHEDULE/HRMS/h/?tab=DEFAULT">Schedule
  of Classes</a> </em>for that term.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>GRD/CDT</strong></font> GRD and CDT indicate
  that the course is available by examination. GRD indicates that the course is
  available by examination for a grade and credit, and CDT indicates that the
  course is available by examination for credit only. These options are not
  available for graduate credit.</p>
  <p><strong><font color="#0000A0">Critical review of modern theory and research
  on. . .&nbsp; societies</font></strong> Course description.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>2R, 3L</strong></font> Class structure. R, L,
  S, and D indicate &quot;recitation&quot; (lecture), &quot;laboratory&quot;,
  &quot;studio&quot;, and &quot;discussion&quot;. 2R, 3L indicates that the
  class meets for two hours of recitation and three hours of laboratory per week
  (based upon 15 weeks). For courses consisting of recitation periods only, the
  number of class hours per week is the same as the unit value and is not
  specified in the course listing.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>ED, ES</strong></font> In addition to the
  above abbreviations for class structure, the College of Engineering and Mines
  uses the abbreviations ED and ES to designate the number of units in the areas
  of &quot;engineering design&quot; and &quot;engineering science&quot;. Thus
  1ED, 2ES signifies that the course meets the requirement for 1 unit of
  engineering design and 2 units of engineering science.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>P</strong></font> Prerequisites. Identifies
  courses or other experiences which must be completed prior to enrolling in the
  course listed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must meet the course prerequisites or
  otherwise satisfy the instructor of his or her preparation to take the course.
  Prerequisites can be waived only at the discretion of the instructor or
  department offering the course.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>CR</strong></font> Concurrent registration.
  Identifies courses which must be taken during the same term as the course
  listed.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>(Identical with HIST 406)</strong></font>
  Cross listing. Identifies other departments which give credit for the same
  course. The complete course description is shown in the course list of the
  &quot;home&quot; department which has instructional responsibility for the
  course. An abbreviated listing appears in the course list of the &quot;cross
  listing&quot; department. Exceptions are <a href="crsdesc.htm#house">house numbered
  courses</a>, which do not have course descriptions.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>May be convened with 506</strong></font>
  Certain 400- and 500-level courses with the same number and title may be
  convened jointly. Students may receive credit for such courses only once,
  whether jointly convened or separately, unless designated [Rpt.] or unless
  special approval is granted by the student's major advisor. The 500-level
  listing designates additional requirements for graduate credit.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>Fee</strong></font> Special course fees
  apply.&nbsp; If special fees apply, the Schedule of Classes will include a
  note and a link to the appropriate Special
  Fees table.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>Field Trip </strong></font>Course activities
  include one or more field trips.</p>
  <p><font color="#0000A0"><strong>Writing Emphasis Course </strong></font>Every
  undergraduate degree program includes at least one required writing-emphasis
  course. Writing-emphasis courses are regular junior- or senior-level courses
  in an academic discipline in which at least half the grade awarded is
  determined by written work appropriate to the academic discipline. Such
  courses are identified with the phrase &quot;Writing Emphasis Course&quot; at
  the end of the course description. Prerequisite to a writing-emphasis course
  is a satisfactory performance on the<big> </big>Upper-Division Writing
  Proficiency Examination (UDWPE) or, for those students whose UDWPE is
  evaluated as unsatisfactory, further developmental work in writing.&nbsp; For
  more information see&nbsp;the <a href="../../../policies/994/udwpe.htm">UDWPE
  Policy</a>.</p>
