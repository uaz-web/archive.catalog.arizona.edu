content and practice pertinent to the study of art and archaeology. Materials science
provides one of the keys for interpreting objects in their historical and cultural
context. 3ES. P, credit for this course or MSE 259 but not for both. (Identical with ANTH
257, ENGR 257).</p>

<p><b><a name="MSE 258" >MSE
258.</a> Laboratory for Materials Science of Art and Archaeological Objects </b>(1) II
Laboratory exercises involving the materials science of art and archaeological objects.
1ES. (Identical with ENGR 258, ANTH 258).</p>

<p><b><a name="NRSC282" >NRSC
282.</a> Biology of Sensation </b>(3) I Touch, hearing, vision, olfaction and taste are
examined to illustrate scientific methods in biology, development of science in a social
context and sensory phenomena in health and disease. (Identical with SP H 282).</p>

<p><b><a name="PHIL305" >PHIL
305.</a> Introduction to Philosophy of Science </b>(3) I II Basic issues in the logic of
science: scientific concepts and their meaning, testing of hypotheses, explanation,
measurement, role of mathematics, truth versus convention, limits of science.</p>

<p><b><a name="PHYS201" >PHYS
201.</a> How Things Work: Physics through Everyday Tools and Devices </b>(3) I II A study
of everyday devices, emphasizing the use of principles of physical science to understand
their operation. Devices ranging from gears and pulleys to satellites and CAT scanners
will be used to illustrate principles of mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, etc.
1D, 2L, 2R. P, completion of Tier One Natural Science courses.</p>

<p><b><a name="PSIO220" >PSIO
220.</a> Human Physiology: The Facts of Life </b>(4) I II Introduction to human biological
function ranging from the cellular to the organ system level with a focus on situations
encountered in daily life. (Identical with MCB 220).</p>

<p><b><a name="PTYS206" >PTYS
206.</a> Our Golden Age of Planetary Exploration </b>(3) I II We will review current
understanding of the contents of our Solar System and emphasize the processes that unite
all of the planets and smaller bodies, such as tectonics, weathering, cratering,
differentiation, and the evolution of oceans and atmospheres. The course will build on
this knowledge to understand humankind's motivation to explore beyond our Solar System,
especially to search for planets around distant stars and to look or listen for evidence
of life elsewhere in the Universe.</p>

<p><b><a name="RA M222" >RA M
222.</a> Arizona Plant Life </b>(3) I Concepts of plant ecology illustrated with examples
from Arizona. Topics include taxonomy, species distribution, community classification and
dynamics, and human influences. 3L, 2R.</p>

<p><b><a name="SP H261" >SP H
261.</a> Anatomy and Physiology of the Speech Mechanism </b>(4) I This course is part I of
a two-semester sequence that covers the anatomy and physiology of the speech mechanism for
human communication. However, the courses are designed to stand alone, such that students
could elect to take only one or the other of the courses without difficulty. This course
will provide basic anatomy and physiologic information concerning the respiratory,
laryngeal, and supraglottal airway subsystems as they pertain to speech production for
human communication. 1L, 3R.</p>

<p><b><a name="SP H262" >SP H
262.</a> Neurobiology of Communication </b>(3) II This course focuses on the role of the
central nervous system in human communication. The study of brain anatomy and physiology
is approached from the perspective of how neurological systems support speech, language,
and hearing and how breakdowns in these systems disrupt aspects of communication.</p>

conservation and management of North American and global wildlife resources and
biodiversity. How conservation requires integration of scientific understanding with needs
of society. P, completion of Tier One Natural Science courses.
