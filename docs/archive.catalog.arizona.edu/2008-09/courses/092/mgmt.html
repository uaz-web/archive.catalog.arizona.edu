Thus, during the first half of this class, we will: (a) explore the criteria of leadership effectiveness, (b) identify those leader behaviors that have been found to be the most important ones for enhancing leadership effectiveness, and (c) explore how you can improve your own leadership “style.”  However, since leadership is dynamic, much of the material in the second half of the class will be directed at understanding some of the challenges that leaders face in different types of organizational and cultural environments.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Special course fee required:</b>&nbsp; Students will be assessed a $20 per unit fee when registering for this course for Winter or any Summer Session.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall, Spring.<!--MGMT440 ends-->
