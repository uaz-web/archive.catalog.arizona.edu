 -- Latina/o Pop: Race, Gender, Sexuality & Popular Culture
 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This course examines how Latinas/os have been a major force in the production of  popular culture. In particular we will critically examine discourses of “Latinidad” (a seamless construction of Latinos as a monolithic group) in the corporate production of identities.  This lack of attention to national origin and historical specificity is one definition of Latinidad.  Latinidad also provides the contradictory grounds where consumer culture meets Latina/o performance. Some artists choose to reappropriate commercial spaces as sites of empowerment, while others are complicit in perpetuating stereotypical representations of Latinas/os.  With special attentiveness to the body,  we will explore the construction of Latina/o identities as they influence and produce particular racial, sexual and gendered identities. The body becomes an essential marker of “Latinidad,”  which is constantly connected to notions of sexuality. We will also examine the material effects of such cultural and commercial practices upon U.S. Latino populations, reminding us that there are real-world implications for these performances as they commodify Latina/o culture.  To account for the shifts in notions of performance and cultural practices, the focus of the course will center Latina/o/Chicana/o musical production, movies, television, advertising, magazines, literary texts, performance art, murals, installation art, music videos, and animation within a historical context.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Prerequisite(s):</b>&nbsp; Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors only.<br><b>Identical to:</b>&nbsp;  W S 312; W S  is home department.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall, Spring.<!--MAS 312 ends-->

 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This interdisciplinary course is a survey of various popular and Indigenous medicinal systems that fall under the rubric known as Mexican Traditional Medicine (MTM).  Mexican scholar Carlos Viesca Treviño defines MTM as medicinal knowledge(s) that emanate from Mesoamerican world views and that have adapted to historical and social conditions in the Americas.  This course will explore various expressions of MTM, with a special emphasis on Indigenous medicinal approaches to healing that exemplify both continuities and adaptations. We will compare across cultures some shared values in various Indigenous systems as well as how they are uniquely expressed in contemporary settings. We will also draw from the local knowledge holders of Indigenous populations from this region to compare various approaches in traditional medicine.  This course will introduce students to the relationship between place, healing and cosmology in Indigenous-based cultures that maintain curing traditions and practices.  We will explore the theories and philosophies that are used in MTM as well as applied knowledge and practices that are useful for self care and community wellness. The group project for graduate students requires a deeper level of analysis. Graduate students will meet in their group an additional three sessions to discuss their research projects. The graduate research paper will be weighted twice as heavy as the undergraduate paper, with greater expectations in research, writing and analysis.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Identical to:</b>&nbsp;   LA S 535,  AIS 535.<br><b>May be convened with:</b>&nbsp; MAS 435.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Spring.<!--MAS 535 ends-->

 -- Critical Race Theories for Policy and Practice
 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This course starts from the premise that race is an essential social category for analyzing the policies and everyday practices experienced in American society. Students will review a variety of theories and discussions of race to learn how to take this premise seriously and understand the relevance of race in their own studies. The review starts with the early race theorists (Boas, Dubois, Sanchez.) who were countering the racist notion of biological inferiority among people of color. Students will move from discussing biological discourses to cultural explanations of racial difference. Postmodern perspectives, which center on the social construction of race, will be discussed. The review also includes an examination of Critical Race Theory (CRT) scholarship and how this school of thought comes to bear on contemporary social problems, such as educational inequities, legal injustice, and xenophobic nationalism. The course covers key and ongoing debates in race theory, including the relationship between capitalism and racism, the limitations of the black/white binary, the intersectionality of race with other social categories (class, gender, sexuality, etc.) and the veracity versus the chimera of social constructions.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall.<!--MAS 565 ends-->
