<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Minimum Number of Units</b></p>
  <p>Colleges or schools, with the approval of the University faculty and the
  Arizona Board of Regents, establish the minimum number of units needed to
  complete an undergraduate minor administered within that unit. All University
  of Arizona minors require at least 18 units; some minors require more than 18
  units. In most cases, at least nine of the 18 units must be upper-division
  units.&nbsp; For additional information about the minimum number of units for a specific
  minor, contact the <a href="../dept/aaindex.html">department</a> that
  administers the minor.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Minor Requirements</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Each college determines
  whether or not the degrees it offers must include a minor.&nbsp; However, any student may declare a minor, even if one is not required
  for completion of the degree requirements.&nbsp; Consult
  your <a href="http://aprr.web.arizona.edu/data/interface/aprrs-144.html">Major 
Academic Advisement Report</a>
  to find out if your degree requires a minor.&nbsp;<b> </b>Minors are discipline-based; that is, the
  <a href="../dept/aaindex.html"> department</a> that offers the
  minor defines its content.&nbsp; The double use of courses in the minor with
other degree requirements is subject to University General Education, college,
and department policies on double dipping.&nbsp; See the 
<a href="double_use.htm">General
Education policy</a> and check with your major and minor advisors for
clarification on the double use of any courses.&nbsp; See the Catalog's<a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">Minors</a>
  section for a list of approved minors with links to their respective requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.000 or better is required 
for all University Credit work in the minor as defined on the Academic 
Advisement Report or for any work in the minor satisfied by the Special 
Examination for Grade.&nbsp; All grades for repeated courses will be calculated 
in the minor GPA, with the exception of grades that have been replaced by the 
Grade Replacement Opportunity (GRO) and those removed from the GPA through 
Academic Renewal.&nbsp; A minimum GPA presupposes that at least one 3-unit 
course in the minor is University Credit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Declaring or Changing a Minor</b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The
  procedure to declare a minor varies among colleges.&nbsp; Students interested in adding a minor should consult with
  their <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://advising.arizona.edu/content/academic-advisor-directory">major advisor</a>
  regarding an
  appropriate choice of minor and the declaration procedure.&nbsp; The declaration of the minor, which may necessitate an approval
  from an advisor in the minor department, is usually processed in the
  student's college academic services office. To change or remove a minor,
  consult with your major advisor before completing this transaction in your
  college academic services office.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Students
  with a declared minor at the time of <a href="degreeapp.htm">application for
  degree candidacy</a> will see the defined minor on their 
  <a href="saar.htm">Student
  Academic Advisement Report (SAAR)</a>.&nbsp; University
  and transfer courses with direct equivalency may satisfy the minor
  requirements.&nbsp; If the student has completed the minor as structured by the minor
  department, there is no need for the signature of the minor advisor on the
  degree audit.&nbsp; However, course substitutions, or the application of transfer
  courses for which there is no direct University equivalency, must be approved
  by an advisor from the minor <a href="../dept/aaindex.html"> department</a>.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A
  student'sacademic transcript will show the name of the ABOR-approved minor.&nbsp;
  In the case of the thematic minor, the transcript will show, &quot;thematic
  minor.&quot;</p>
  <p><b><a name="Thematic">Thematic</a> Minor</b></p>
  <p>Students have the option of declaring a thematic minor. The thematic
  minor is developed around a theme identified by the student, using courses
  from two or more disciplines. The <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://advising.arizona.edu/content/academic-advisor-directory">major advisor</a> must approve all thematic
  minors. For further information and to print the Thematic Minor Form, see <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">Thematic Minors</a>
  on the Registrar's Office site.&nbsp; For more information about the approval process for thematic minors
  contact your major advisor.</p>
