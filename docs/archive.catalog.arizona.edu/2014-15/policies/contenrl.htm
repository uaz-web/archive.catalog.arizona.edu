<h2 align="center">Academic Policies</h2>
<h4 align="center">Continuous Enrollment for Undergraduates</h4>
</b>Students may maintain continuous enrollment whether attending a single
  public community college or university in Arizona or transferring among public
  institutions in Arizona while pursuing their degrees. Continuous enrollment
  status of a student and the <a href="../../allcats.html"> catalog</a> of determination for a student are defined
  by:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A semester in which a student earns course credit will be counted toward
      continuous enrollment. Non-credit courses, <a href="audit.htm"> audited
      courses</a>, failed courses,
      or courses from which the student withdraws do not count toward the
      determination of continuous enrollment for catalog purposes.</li>
    <li>Students who do not meet the minimum enrollment standard stipulated in
      No. 1 during three consecutive semesters (Fall, Spring) and the intervening
      summer term at any public Arizona community college or university are no
      longer considered continuously enrolled, and must meet requirements of the
      public Arizona community college or university catalog in effect at the
      time they are readmitted or of any single catalog in effect during
      subsequent terms of continuous enrollment after readmission. Students are
      not obligated to enroll and earn course credit during summer terms, but
      summer enrollment may be used to maintain continuous enrollment status.</li>
    <li>Students admitted or readmitted to a public Arizona community college or
      university during a summer term must follow the requirements of the
      catalog in effect the following fall semester or of any single catalog in
      effect during subsequent terms of continuous enrollment.</li>
    <li>Students transferring among Arizona public higher education institutions
      must meet the admission requirements, residency requirements, and all
      curricular and academic requirements of the degree-granting institution.</li>
    <li>Students under the 1997-98 and prior catalogs must follow the general
      education requirements of those catalogs; they do not have the option of
      using a subsequent catalog for general education purposes.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Exceptions to these policies are the prerogative of the college. Students
  should contact their college dean'soffice for more information.</p>
