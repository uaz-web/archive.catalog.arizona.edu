<p><b>
  Mathematics Placement Test:</b></p>

  <p>Registration in all MATH courses below MATH 129, as well as MATH 163,  MATH 263, and MATH 302A,  
  requires all students to take the UA Mathematics Placement Test.   Test scores are valid for one year.&nbsp;This requirement includes transfer students
  with or without mathematics credit and students with credit by examination,
  such as Advanced Placement (AP), CLEP, or International Baccalaureate (IB).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eligibility rules and testing information may be
found on the <img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">

 Homepage.</a></p>
<p><b>Foundations Mathematics 
Requirement:</b></p>
<p>
All students, as part of their Foundations requirements, are expected 
to demonstrate mathematical knowledge and quantitative reasoning by completing 
one of the following 3-unit courses or by achieving a minimum math placement 
code as stated below: </p>
<ol>
	<li>
	
	earning credit for <u>
	<a href="https://uaccess.schedule.arizona.edu/psp/uazsaprd2/UA_CATALOG/HRMS/h/?tab=DEFAULT">LING 123</a>,</u> 
	(Introduction to Mathematical Approaches to Language), or <u>
	<a href="https://uaccess.schedule.arizona.edu/psp/uazsaprd2/UA_CATALOG/HRMS/h/?tab=DEFAULT">MATH 105</a></u> (Mathematics in Modern Society), or 
	<u>
	<a href="https://uaccess.schedule.arizona.edu/psp/uazsaprd2/UA_CATALOG/HRMS/h/?tab=DEFAULT">PHIL 
	110</a></u> (Logic and Critical Thinking)-check prerequisites, such as a minimum 
	math placement code (see the chart provided on the
	<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://math.arizona.edu/academics/placement/courses">Math Placement Homepage</a>); or 
	<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
	earning credit for any 3-unit (or more) mathematics course numbered above 
	Math 105, provided that the student has placed at the level required for the 
	course (see the chart provided on the
	<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://math.arizona.edu/academics/placement/courses">Math Placement Homepage</a>); or 
	<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
	achieving a math placement code equivalent to that of students who have 
	completed UA College Algebra-by the end of the student'sfirst semester at 
	the UA (see the chart provided on the
	<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://math.arizona.edu/academics/placement/courses">Math Placement Homepage</a>, as well as 
	<u><a href="../../2011-12/policies/profexam.htm">Proficiency and Exemption Exam Procedures and General Regulations</a></u>).&nbsp; 
	[Note:&nbsp; <em style="font-style: normal">
	<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">the 
	placement&nbsp;code is determined by the&nbsp;catalog and math placement regulations</em> 
	in effect when an exam is taken.] If the Math Placement Test is used for this purpose, the test must be proctored per 
	Math Department guidelines, which may be found on the 
	<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://math.arizona.edu/academics/placement/courses">Math Placement Homepage</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond this general minimum, 
however, the appropriate course for an individual student will depend on the 
student'smajor and the corresponding <u><a href="math.htm#strands">math strand</a></u> appropriate to that 
major.</p>
<p><b><a name="strands">Math Strands:</a></b></p>
<p>Entry-level mathematics students should choose one of three strands
  according to their interests, preparation, and intended major. All strands
  presume that students will have completed the high school math required for
  entry to the University.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><b>
	G-Strand</b> (General Knowledge) -- This strand involves the general 
	understanding and appreciation of how mathematics is used to solve problems 
	in everyday life.&nbsp; The G-strand does not prepare a student for any further 
	work grounded in mathematics and assumes the student will not proceed beyond 
	the basic Foundations level noted above.&nbsp; Thus only those students whose 
	major requires the most general knowledge of mathematics should take this 
	strand.&nbsp; The options to satisfy this strand are:&nbsp; </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	
earning credit for 
	<u>
<a href="https://uaccess.schedule.arizona.edu/psp/uazsaprd2/UA_CATALOG/HRMS/h/?tab=DEFAULT">LING 123,</a></u> 
(Introduction to Mathematical Approaches to Language), or <u>
<a href="https://uaccess.schedule.arizona.edu/psp/uazsaprd2/UA_CATALOG/HRMS/h/?tab=DEFAULT">
MATH 105</a></u> (Mathematics in Modern Society), or 
	<u>

	<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://math.arizona.edu/academics/placement/courses">Math Placement Homepage</a>); or 
	</p>
<p>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	
earning credit for any 3-unit (or more) mathematics course numbered 
	above Math 105, provided that the student has placed at the level required 
	for the course (see the chart provided on the
	<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://math.arizona.edu/academics/placement/courses">Math Placement Homepage</a>); or 
	</p>
<p>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	
achieving a math placement code equivalent to that of students who 
	have completed UA College Algebra-by the end of the student'sfirst semester 
	at the UA (see the chart provided on the
	<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://math.arizona.edu/academics/placement/courses">Math Placement Homepage</a>, as well as 
	<u><a href="../../2011-12/policies/profexam.htm">Proficiency and Exemption Exam Procedures and General Regulations</a></u>).&nbsp; 
	[Note: <em>the placement&nbsp;code is determined by the&nbsp;catalog and math placement 
	regulations</em><i> </i>in effect when an exam is taken.]
	<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">If the 
Math Placement Test is used for this purpose, the test must be proctored per 
Math Department guidelines, which may be found on the 
	<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://math.arizona.edu/academics/placement/courses">Math Placement Homepage</a>.</span></p>
<ul>
  
  <li>
	<p class="style2"><b>M-Strand</b> (Moderate Knowledge)  -- The M-strand is for students
    who require mathematical facility at the level of at least MATH
    112 (College Algebra Concepts) or 109C
    (Applied College Algebra). This strand involves reasonable facility with algebra
    and algebraic functions, graphs, and simple modeling. Students who choose
    the M-strand are prepared for further mathematical work. This work may
    include LING 178 (The Mathematics of Language and Linguistics), MATH
    113 (Elements of Calculus), MATH 116 (Calculus Concepts for Business), or a
    statistics class from outside the Mathematics Department, such as ISTA 116 
	(Statistical Foundations for the Information Age) or SBS 200 (Statistics for 
	the Social Sciences).<br>
	<br>
  </li>
  
  <li><p class="style2"><b>S-Strand</b> (Substantial Knowledge)  -- This strand involves skill
    and facility with calculus. The S-strand begins at one of two calculus
    options - MATH 122A/B (Functions for Calculus and First-Semester Calculus) or MATH
    125 (Calculus I).
    Students who successfully complete the S-strand may continue on to MATH
    129 (Calculus II), MATH 223 (Vector Calculus), or beyond. Those who choose but are not ready to begin the
    S-strand will be required to take preparatory work.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>Each major indicates the mathematics
strand, or specific course from a strand, that is most appropriate for its
students.&nbsp; It is important to note that each strand provides a different
  level of mathematical training, but students can satisfy the mathematics
  requirement in their major by completing a more advanced mathematics course.
  Because the S-strand presumes the M-strand and the M-strand presumes the
  G-strand, students will have the most flexibility in their major choice by
  aiming for the S-strand. A student who chooses to meet the general education mathematics requirement with the G-strand will have the most restricted set of
  major choices.</p>
