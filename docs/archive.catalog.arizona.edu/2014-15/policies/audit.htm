<h2 align="center">Academic Policies</h2>
<h4 align="center">Audit Policy</h4>
<p>Audit is a registration status allowing students to attend a course without
receiving credit. Both graduate and undergraduate students may audit
courses. Audit units do not count toward <a href="fs_enrpol.htm"> full-time
status</a>, nor do audited courses count
toward the determination of <a href="contenrl.htm"> continuous
enrollment</a>   for catalog purposes.</p>
<p>Registration for audit is at the course instructor's discretion; at the time of approval for audit registration, the instructor and
student will agree upon the student's level of
participation in the class. The instructor may <a href="classatten.htm">administratively
drop</a> the student for nonattendance. Students are required to process a
 Change of Schedule
form to withdraw from the class.</p>
<p>Students may change registration in a course from credit to audit under the following
conditions (this applies for all sessions/terms):</p>
<ol>
  <li>deadline to drop without a grade of W is also the deadline to change from credit to audit, or vice
  versa, with only an instructor's signature</li>
  <li>after the deadline to drop without a grade of W, a change from
    credit to audit will be permitted only if the student is doing
  passing work in that course and receives the approval of
  the course instructor</li>
  <li>after the deadline to drop with a grade of W, a change from
    credit to audit, or vice versa, will be permitted only
  if the student receives the approval of the course
  instructor AND the dean of the student's <a href="../dept/aaindex.html">college</a>.&nbsp;
  <i>By Policy, permission from the dean to make registration</i> <i> changes
  after the last day to drop with a grade of W requires an extraordinary
  reason.  </i> </li>
</ol>
