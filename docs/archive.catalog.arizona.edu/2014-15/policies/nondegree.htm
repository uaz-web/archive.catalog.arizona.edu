<h2 align="center">Academic Policies</h2>
<h4 align="center">Non-Degree Seeking Students</h4>
<p align="left"><b>Undergraduate</b></p>
		<p align="left">A student may enroll in University courses through undergraduate non-degree status. A maximum of 15 credits completed as a
non-degree seeking student may be used for fulfilling undergraduate degree
requirements. Non-degree students, with the exception of students enrolled in the Arizona Universities Network (AZUN), are not eligible for 
federal financial
aid. Non-degree students are not eligible for housing during Fall or Spring
semesters, but may apply for Summer housing. A student disqualified from the
University cannot attend as a non-degree student.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Graduate</b></p>
<p>Individuals holding a bachelor's degree, or its equivalent, from a college or university that grants 
degrees recognized by The University of Arizona, may enroll in graduate-level courses without being admitted 
to a specific graduate degree program. Such students may enroll in graduate-level course work as their qualifications 
and performance permit. It is advisable to contact the department(s) offering courses of interest to ensure that those 
courses are available to non-degree students.  Non-degree students are not eligible for federal financial aid or for 
any financial assistance offered by The University of Arizona.  International applicants with a student visa are not 
eligible for graduate non-degree admission.</p>
<p>Applicants who do not meet the minimum required cumulative grade-point average (GPA) of 3.000 for admission to a graduate 
degree program may enroll in graduate non-degree status. After completing 12 consecutive semester units of graded (A, B, C) 
500-level or higher course work with a minimum 3.000 GPA, non-degree students may apply for admission to a graduate degree program. </p>
<p>Up to 12 units of graduate credit earned in non-degree status, and/or transferred from other institutions, may be applied toward 
a graduate degree program once the student obtains regular admission to a degree program. </p>
<p>Applications for non-degree status, along with the required application fee, must be submitted to the Graduate College no later than 
7 days before classes begin.  To avoid late registration penalties assessed by the Bursar's Office, students should be admitted and registered 
for classes, with accounts paid in full, before the first day of classes.  See the<img border="0" src="/2011-12/images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
