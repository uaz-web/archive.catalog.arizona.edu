Entrance Requirements: Entrance examinations in musicianship and

Students may, at the discretion of their major adviser or
performance instructor, be required to register for MUS 201 and

unless the instructor has been notified by the student 24 hours
before the regular time of the lesson. Lessons missed by the
instructor will be rescheduled within the semester. Lessons
falling on a legal holiday will not be rescheduled.
