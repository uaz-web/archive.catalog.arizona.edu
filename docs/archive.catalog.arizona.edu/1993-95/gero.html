Because of its multidisciplinary nature, courses in gerontology
are located in a number of departments. The Graduate
Interdisciplinary Program in Gerontology plays a facilitating
role in the coordination and development of aging studies and
will guide students who wish to include an emphasis in
gerontology in their course of study. Although the program offers
neither an undergraduate nor graduate major, it is possible for
students to include an emphasis in gerontology in several ways.
Students may choose to incorporate courses into their regular
degree program to supplement work in their major field. In
addition they can pursue a gerontological focus through work in a
practicum, internship, independent study or thesis. While no
formal recognition is offered, it is possible to obtain a rich
background in gerontology in this way.

Formal recognition for gerontological study is available at both
undergraduate and graduate levels. In the College of Arts and
Sciences an undergraduate may satisfy requirements for a minor or
for Subject Area III in interdisciplinary studies by following an
approved curriculum. At the graduate level the Program offers a
doctoral minor which is most appropriate for students in areas
such as education, administration, health, nutrition, and the
social and behavioral sciences. A minimum of 15 units is
required. In addition it is possible for graduate students to
obtain formal recognition through the Gerontology Certificate
Program, an 18-unit course of study similar to that offered in
many other colleges and universities in this country. The program
is designed primarily for individuals planning to enter or to
continue in a profession which involves provision of services
and/or administration of programs for the aging. 

Students should consult with the major department about
developing a gerontological emphasis within the major field
through course work, research, thesis and dissertation. This most
commonly occurs in the following academic units: Counseling and
Guidance, Psychology, Special Education and Rehabilitation,
Speech and Hearing Sciences, the School of Family and Consumer
Resources, the School of Public Administration and Policy, and
the Colleges of Education, Nursing and Pharmacy. In addition,
graduate work with a strong gerontological focus is available in
human services administration (M.P.A.) and nursing/geriatric
nurse practitioner (M.S.).
