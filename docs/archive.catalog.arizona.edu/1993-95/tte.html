The department offers programs directed toward the certification
of elementary and secondary school teachers, the continuing
education of certified members of the teaching profession, and
advanced graduate preparation of professional educators.

At the undergraduate level, the department offers programs
leading to the Bachelor of Arts in Education with a major in
elementary education. In addition, students may work toward
endorsements in bilingual education and middle level education. A
specialization in early childhood education is also available.

In the area of secondary education, both the Bachelor of Arts in
Education and the Bachelor of Science in Education degrees are
available. Students interested in teaching at the secondary
school level will select a subject area teaching major and earn
the degree appropriate to the chosen major. See the College of
Education section of this catalog. Secondary education students
need a teaching minor unless they have an extended major, e.g.
social studies or English. Prospective students should consult
the Office of Student Services within the College of Education
for more information.

A certification program for post-baccalaureate teacher candidates
is also available. Interested students are encouraged to consult
advisors in the academic discipline of their proposed teaching
major for information about appropriate course work in that
discipline. For information about courses in the College of
Education, students should consult the Office of Student Services
within the College of Education.

Admission requirements for undergraduate students and post-
baccalaureate certification candidates are explained in the
College of Education section of this catalog. Restrictions on
enrollment in education courses are also detailed in this section
of the catalog.

For information regarding the professional education course
sequence, please consult an advisor in the Office of Student
Services. Requirements for teaching majors and minors are listed
under the appropriate academic department in the Departments and
Courses of Instruction section of this catalog.
