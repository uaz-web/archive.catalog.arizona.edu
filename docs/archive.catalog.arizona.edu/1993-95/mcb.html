The University Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology
offers the Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, and Doctor of
Philosophy degrees with a major in molecular and cellular
biology. The department will only admit graduate students whose
stated objective is the Doctor of Philosophy degree.

The major: 181R, 182, 320, 410, 411, 462a, and at least three
units of an upper-division laboratory course (such as 413, 473 or
494); CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b, 241a-241b, 243a-243b; PHYS 104a-
104b; MATH 125a or 124 and 125b. Writing emphasis course
requirements can be met by taking 404, 470, 473, 455 or 498H.
With the assistance of a major advisor, the student must select a
minimum of 30 units, including at least 6 units of upper-division
molecular and cellular biology courses. All majors are encouraged
to undertake independent research and they are strongly advised
to include CHEM 480a-480b in their program.

Biology teaching major: Students interested in teaching secondary
school biology, which includes molecular and cellular biology,
should see the list of required courses under Department of
