The objectives of the African American Studies Program are to
provide students with opportunities to learn about the African
heritage in the Americas. Its curriculum is designed 1) to
explore past and present cultural, political, and economic links
between Africa and African descent populations in the Americas,
and 2) to provide a comparative interdisciplinary theoretical and
methodological examination of issues shaping the lives of persons
of African descent in the United States and other nations of the
Americas. The program seeks to accomplish these goals by 1)
identifying courses offered in other departments and programs
which focus on Africa or populations of African descent in the
Americas, and 2) providing a minor in African American studies
which provides different perspectives from which to examine
issues to which students are exposed. African American studies
courses are intended to supplement disciplinary offering as well
as provide students with perspectives from within and across
disciplines which challenge and question their established
theories, methods, and conclusions.

For the minor in African American studies, students are required
to successfully complete twenty-two (22) credit hours of courses.
Ten (10) credit hours must be taken in Area I and the remaining
twelve (12) can be taken in any one, not a combination, of the
other four study areas. Cross-listed offerings acceptable for the
African American studies requirement are included in the
appropriate study area described below. (Note: these acceptable
cross-listed courses may change. Students should seek advice from
the African American studies advisor to determine whether a
course is acceptable.)

Study Area I: African American studies theory and methodology:
examines the past and present research agenda of African American
studies. Courses in this area address the development of the
field in relation to changes in issues of concern to African
descent populations in the Americas. Courses in this area examine
problems in the institutionalization of African American studies,
the interdisciplinary nature of its methodology and theory; and
exploration of disciplines, scholars, and historical events which
have influenced the foci of its past and contemporary research
agenda--ten (10) credits.

Study Area II: African American literature, literary criticism
and drama: examines historical developments and contemporary
variations in the literary and performing arts of African descent
populations in Africa and the Americas. Courses in this area
attend to the sociopolitical and economic context of artistic
productions with special attention to the implications such
contexts have for general literary and symbolic theories--twelve
(12) credit hours, at least three (3) of which should be devoted
to a course that explores the influence of gender on variations
in artistic productions.

and economy: examines the form, function and implications of
underlying processes in the historical formation of contemporary
demographic, economic, and political patterns that characterize
African descent populations in the Americas in comparison with
those of the African continent--twelve (12) credit hours, at
least three (3) of which should be devoted to a course that is
primarily focused on Africa, and three (3) to one that directs
attention to an African descent population outside of the United
States but in the Americas.

theories of culture formation, personality development, stages of
moral development, and sociopolitical integration with special
attention to their comparative implications among Americans of
African descent within and across the categorical distinctions
generally referred to as &quot;racial groups,&quot; and &quot;class strata&quot;--12
