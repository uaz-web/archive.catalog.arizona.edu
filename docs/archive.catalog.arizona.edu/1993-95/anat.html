The Department of Anatomy offers a program of study leading up to
the Doctor of Philosophy degree with a major in anatomy. The
Master of Science degree is offered only in rare instances in
which students are unable to continue in the doctoral program.
Research areas of faculty include biological anthropology,
cellular and systems biology, cancer cell biology, developmental
biology, endocrinology, molecular biology, neurobiology and
reproductive biology. For admission and degree requirements,
please see the Graduate Catalog.
