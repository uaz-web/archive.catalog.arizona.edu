Sociology is the study of human society, its origins, functions,
and problems. It focuses on relations among people, groups,
organizations, classes, and cultures. Sociology explores and
analyzes issues vital to our personal lives, our communities, our
nation, and the world. The curriculum in sociology is designed to
show students the social character of human life and the impact
of varying forms of social organization on human affairs.
Students are introduced to the methods by which knowledge is
obtained, and may examine the results of research on such diverse
topics as the family, religion, education, politics, and crime.

The major provides a foundation for careers in many professional
fields, such as law, criminal justice, and social service, and
for graduate training as a professional sociologist in
government, business, community agencies, research organizations,
or educational institutions.

Students are important to the department, and the names and
office hours of faculty and student advisors are posted on the
department's undergraduate bulletin board. Students should feel
free to discuss academic, career, or related matters with these
advisors.

Undergraduates are encouraged to become actively involved in the
design of their education, and to take advantage of the
opportunities and services offered by the department.
Internships, practicums, and independent study courses (393, 394,
and 399), help students establish ties to social service agencies
and individual professors. The Sociology Club and the
Undergraduate Criminal Justice Club offer further opportunities
for participation in departmental and community affairs. Alpha
Kappa Delta, the national honorary society, and the Maynard
Erickson Award provide opportunities for those interested in
academic excellence. Details are available in the Handbook for
Sociology Majors, which may be obtained in the departmental
office.

The major for the B.A. requires a minimum of 36 units of
sociology, 21 of which must be upper-division courses. All majors
must take 101, 274, 275, and 300, which provide students with an
overview of the discipline and the fundamentals of its research
methods and statistics. The student may then select one of five
programs: (1) a general program that allows the student to select
eight courses from the entire range of courses offered by the
department (six of which must be upper division); (2) a topical
specialization that requires a minimum of four courses in one of
the four areas. The four areas, with appropriate course listings,
are as follows: (a) social problems and policy: 150, 160, 189,
201, 313, 341, 342, 343, 459, 467; (b) institutions and
organizations: 251, 303, 315, 317, 321, 322, 326, 420, 422, 434,
441; (c) social and cultural diversity: 150, 160, 161, 384, 450,
459, 467; (d) self and society: 310, 324, 333, 340, 436.

Students planning to major in sociology should complete 101, 274,
275, and 300 before enrolling in other sociology courses. (Upper
division courses require completion of 56 units, or permission of
the instructor. Otherwise unless specifically indicated,
sociology courses do not have prerequisites. The Writing-Emphasis
course is 300 (for prerequisites, see course listing). Required
courses other than 101 (274, 275, and 300) are not offered in
summer sessions. Electives may include up to six units of 393,
394, and 399.

The supporting minor for sociology majors is chosen by the
student in consultation with an advisor. The minor in sociology
for nonmajors consists of 20 units, 12 of which must be in the
upper division.

The teaching minor: 21 units, including 251, 274, 275, and 300.
