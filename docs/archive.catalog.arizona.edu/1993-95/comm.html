The Department of Communication offers courses to promote
understanding of the functions of communication at all levels of
society, from interpersonal communication to the social effects
of mass media. Because communication is the most basic social
behavior and the means by which the individual functions in
society, the study of communication is relevant to all academic
and career interests.

The degrees offered by the department are the Bachelor of Arts;
the Master of Arts, including an interdisciplinary option in
organizational communication; and the Doctor of Philosophy, all
with a major in communication. Students should consult the

degree. For graduate admission and degree requirements, students
