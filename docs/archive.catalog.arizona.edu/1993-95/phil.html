Philosophy attempts to answer analytic and speculative questions
that perplex reflective people when they examine their basic
concepts, goals, and ideals. Some of these questions arise
naturally in the course of work in the various sciences and
humanities. Hence philosophy has a natural border with all other
academic disciplines, and lends itself to joint studies and
collaborations.

The Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy
degrees are available with a major in philosophy. The department
also encourages joint majors in such related fields as
psychology, political science, economics, and linguistics, among
others. Specialized minors in philosophy are available for
students planning careers in law or the health professions. For
details, students should consult the philosophy department's
undergraduate advisor.

The major: 30 units, including 344 and at least one course from
each of the following groups: (1) history of ancient philosophy;
(2) history of modern philosophy; (3) ethics and value theory;
(4) metaphysics and epistemology; (5) logic and language. For a
complete list of courses that satisfy each of these areas, please
see the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

The supporting minor should be chosen after consultation with the
undergraduate advisor.

The department participates in the honors program, offering
honors sections of its introductory courses, periodic honors
seminars, and the opportunity to conduct independent honors
research.
