The Department of Chemistry provides both general and
professional training, giving a strong foundation upon which to
base a career in the fields of medicine and related health
sciences, in secondary education, or leading to industrial work
or graduate specialization in chemistry.

The degrees of Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts with a
major in chemistry, and Bachelor of Science in Education and
Bachelor of Arts in Education with a teaching major or minor in
chemistry are offered. A Master of Arts, Master of Science and
Doctor of Philosophy with a major in chemistry are also
available, as is a Master of Education with a teaching major in
chemistry.

The major for the B.S.: The Bachelor of Science degree in
chemistry is for students planning careers as professional
chemists and is also the degree for students planning on post-
graduate study in chemistry. The curriculum for the B.S. degree
meets the professional requirements of the American Chemical
Society. The following courses are required: 103a-103b and 104a-
104b, or 105a-105b and 106a-106b; 241a-241b or 242a-242b; 245a-
245b; 325; 326; 396 or 396H; 400a-400b; 405; 410; 424; 480a-480b;
and at least six additional units in chemistry chosen from the
following: 412, 440, 446, and 460 or 462a-462b. At least three of
the six additional units must be a laboratory course (412, 440,
and 446 are laboratory courses). Students planning to pursue
careers as practicing chemists are encouraged to fulfill the
foreign language requirement with German, Russian, or Japanese.

All students are strongly encouraged to participate in
undergraduate research through enrollment in CHEM 199, 299, 399,
or 499. Consult your chemistry advisor for additional information
on this program.

MATH 124, 125b, and 223; and PHYS 104a-104b and 180a-180b are
prerequisite to courses in the major. Completion of the above
Math and Physics courses meets the requirements for a Math-
Physics split minor. Other minors may be chosen with the approval
of the chemistry advisor.

The major for the B.A.: The Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry
is intended for students who do not plan to pursue post-graduate
study in chemistry and are planning on a non-laboratory career.
The degree affords a broader exposure to chemistry than the B.S.
degree, and is intended for students needing this type of
background for careers in business, law, medicine, etc. Students
following the B.A. program may choose any language to satisfy the
foreign language requirement. The following courses are required:
103a-103b and 104a-104b, or 105a-105b and 106a-106b; 241a-241b or
242a-242b; 243a-243b or 245a-245b; 325; 326; 396 or 396H; 405;
480a-480b (or 481 in place of 480b); and one of the following
pairs of courses: 462a-462b or 424-400a or 410-412.

MATH 124 and 125b; PHYS 104a-104b and 180a-180b are prerequisite
to courses in the major for the B.A. At least two additional
units in mathematics or physics are needed to complete the Math-
Physics split minor. These units should be chosen in consultation
with the chemistry advisor.

The chemistry minor: 103a-103b, 104a-104b, or 105a-105b and 106a-
106b, and any additional chemistry courses at the 200 level or
higher to give a minimum of twenty units of credit. At least two
of these additional units must be laboratory courses. CHEM 296,
396, and 302 are not acceptable for the first twenty units of the
minor.

The chemistry teaching major: Students wishing to acquire a B.S.
degree in education with a teaching major in chemistry enroll in
the College of Arts and Sciences as pre-education chemistry
majors for the freshman and sophomore years. In the sophomore
year students apply for admission and subsequently transfer to
the College of Education to complete their junior and senior
years. Students should consult with their chemistry advisor and
also with a pre-education advisor in the College of Education to
plan their course work. 

The chemistry teaching major curriculum is designed to provide
depth in the fundamentals of chemistry as well as breadth in
mathematics and other basic sciences. Students following the
teaching major program should consider Spanish for the foreign
language requirement. The following courses are required: 103a-
103b and 104a-104b or 105a-105b, and 106a-106b; 241a-241b or
242a-242b; 243a-243b or 245a-245b; 325, 326; 405; 433; and 480a-
480b; MATH 124, 125b; PHYS 104a-104b and 180a-180b; PHYS 433 or
BIOC 433; MCB 181-182 or GEOS 101-102-103-104.

The chemistry teaching minor: 103a-103b and 104a-104b, or 105a-
105b and 106a-106b; 241a-241b or 242a-242b; 243a-243b or 245a-
245b; 325 or 322; 326 or 323. 433 is also recommended.

The double major in chemistry and biochemistry: A student may
earn a B.S. degree with majors in chemistry and biochemistry by
successful completion of the appropriate required courses.
Students seeking such a degree must consult with advisors in the
Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry to plan a suitable
program.

The double B.S. degree in chemistry and biochemistry: A student
may earn B.S. degrees in both fields by successful completion of
the appropriate required courses. Students seeking these two
