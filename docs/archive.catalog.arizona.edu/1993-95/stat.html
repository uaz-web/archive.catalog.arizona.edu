Study of statistics enables one to model the uncertainty in data
and draw organized scientific conclusions from it. Data from
different disciplines post different statistical problems and
hence statistics is inherently an interdisciplinary field. The
department offers both theoretical and applied courses.
Statistics is available as a major in the Master of Science and
the Doctor of Philosophy degrees.

160. Introduction to Statistics (3) I II Descriptive statistics.
Basic probability concepts and probability distributions,
elementary sampling theory and techniques of estimation,
hypothesis testing, regression and correlation. Some analysis of
variance and nonparametric tests if time permits. Not applicable
to the math major. P, MATH 117R/S.

163. Beginning Statistics in Bioscience (3) I II Basic concepts
of probability and statistics. Descriptive statistics commonly
used in biological and medical sciences such as mean, standard
deviation, odds ratio and risk. Interpretation of statistical
