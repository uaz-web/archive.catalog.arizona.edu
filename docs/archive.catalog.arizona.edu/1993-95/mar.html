The department provides instructional programs designed to
prepare students to assume leadership roles in the media arts as
independent artists or as members of industries such as film,
television, and cable television. Course work focuses upon

media arts. The department offers courses leading to the Bachelor
of Arts in Media Arts and Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with a
major in Media Arts. Advanced students have opportunities to
obtain preprofessional experience through the department's
internship program, through work on various departmental
projects, and through work at the University's Public
Broadcasting stations KUAT-TV, KUAT-AM, and KUAT-FM.

The Bachelor of Arts in Media Arts is for students planning
careers in electronic journalism or media management, or seeking
a well-balanced liberal arts education in preparation for
graduate study at the M.A. or Ph.D. level.
