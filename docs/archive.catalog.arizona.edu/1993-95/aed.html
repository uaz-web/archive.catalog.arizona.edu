<pre>Agricultural Education (A ED)
Forbes Building, Room 224
(520) 621-1523

Professors Roger T. Huber, Head, (Entomology), Clinton O. Jacobs
(Emeritus), Floyd G. McCormick (Emeritus), Kenneth S. Olson,
Phillip R. Zurbrick

Associate Professors David E. Cox, Glen M. Miller

The programs of study in agricultural education prepare students
for entering careers working with people in a variety of
settings. These positions require preparation in basic sciences,
technical agriculture, knowledge of the principles and techniques
of the teaching-learning process, communication skills and the
ability to work with people.

The department offers the degree of Bachelor of Science in
Agriculture with majors in agricultural education and
agricultural technology management. The major in agricultural
education has two options: teaching education in agriculture and
non-formal education.

The department also offers programs of study leading to the
degrees of Master of Science and Master of Agricultural
Education. A strong emphasis in international development studies
is offered at the graduate level. (See the Graduate Catalog for
detailed information concerning graduate programs.)

One of the options in the agricultural education major, teacher
education in agriculture, prepares students for certified
teaching careers at the secondary school or the community college
level. Such teaching positions require preparation in the basic
sciences, agricultural sciences and technology, communications,
and knowledge and application of the principles and techniques of
the teaching-learning process through professional education
course work.

The option in teacher education in agriculture, which leads to
teaching, includes course work which meets the requirements for
Arizona secondary school teacher certification in agricultural
education. In addition, persons who complete the program meet the
requirements for Arizona secondary school teacher certification
in general science.

Any student who plans to become a certificated teacher must be
formally admitted to teacher education in agriculture prior to
enrolling in professional education course work which includes
placement in student teaching (A ED 489). Admission requires the
completion of a formal process; including a cumulative grade
point average of 2.000 or better, participation in an interview
with faculty, and successful completion of any mandated admission
tests in effect. Contact a faculty advisor in the department for
specific requirements.

Degree requirements: Students must complete course work in the
appropriate basic skills and proficiencies, as well as the study
areas described under the general education requirements in the
College of Agriculture section of the General Catalog. The option
in teacher education in agriculture requires students to complete
31 units of the following professional education courses: A ED
221, 301, 338a, 409, 485, 496a, 496b, 497a, 497h, 489. In
addition, 37 units, including the following course work in
agriculture are required: A ED 100, 350, 351; 5 units in plant
sciences and/or soil science; 5 units in animal sciences; 5 units
in agricultural economics; and 5 units in renewable natural
resources. Teacher certification in agricultural education
requires a total of 50 semester units of agricultural course
work. Contact a faculty advisor in the department for specific
Arizona teacher certification requirements.

This option has two areas of focus, agricultural or environmental
education. Graduates with this option are prepared for a career
in agriculture where educational expertise is desired. The non-
formal agricultural education focus is similar to the teacher
education in agriculture option, except students do not complete
student teaching (A ED 489). Students complete other agricultural
or related courses in lieu of A ED 489. The non-formal
environmental education focus prepares students for a career
emphasizing environmental education or for a career in an agency
where environmental educational expertise is desired.

Degree requirements: Students in either area of focus must
complete A ED 221, 301, 305, 439, 496a and 497h. In addition to
the previously mentioned courses, students in the non-formal
environmental education focus must complete AREC 350, A ED 402
and 422, RNR 316 or ECOL 206, RNR 384 and S W 105/106. Students
in this option complete a minimum of 18 credits in agricultural
education and/or education.

Agricultural Technology Management

This major is designed to prepare students to become skilled in
the many aspects of agricultural technology, environmental
protection, communication, business and economics. Graduates will
be prepared for positions in small to large-scale operations
where 1) an understanding of environmental complexities, 2) an
ability to communicate, and 3) technical competence are
important. Employment opportunities include:
production/management/sales positions, certified plant/animal
protection specialists, and many agricultural service-oriented
positions.

Students may develop a specific option in consultation with a
faculty advisor in the department. For example, options may be
developed in plant sciences, renewable natural resources,
veterinary science, etc. Students who elect the plant science
option will have the courses necessary to qualify for California
and Arizona pest control advisor certification. Graduates
planning to enter post-graduate programs in the agricultural
sciences will have met most admission requirements.

[np]Degree requirements: Students must complete course work in
the appropriate basic skills and proficiencies, as well as the
study areas described under the general education requirements in
the College of Agriculture section of the General Catalog. In
addition, the following courses are required: ACCT 200, 210, AREC
213, 215, 350, A ED 402, ABE 404, COMM 312, 412, ECOL 206, ENGL
307 or 308, ENTO 201R/L, MAP 330, MATH 118, 119, or 123, 3 units
of statistics, PL P 205 and S W 105, 106, 200, 201. Specialized
options can be developed by contacting a faculty advisor for
specific requirements.
