Curricula in geography and regional development are designed to
contribute to general education; to provide a solid substantive
and methodological grounding in geography for those who plan to
teach or pursue graduate work in the field; and to provide
preparation for those persons desiring professional training
and/or careers in such fields as urban and regional planning,
land development, resource management, environmental policy-
making, foreign service, and cartography and remote sensing.

The degrees of Bachelor of Arts with a major in geography and
Bachelor of Science with a major in regional development are
available through the College of Arts and Sciences and the
Bachelor of Arts in Education, with a teaching major in
geography, is available through the College of Education. In
addition, the Master of Arts, Master of Education, and Doctor of
Philosophy degrees are offered with a major in geography. The
Master of Science with a major in planning (regional planning
concentration) is offered through the Graduate College for
students wishing professional preparation for careers in planning
for urban and rural regions. For graduate admission and degree
requirements, consult the Graduate Catalog.

The major in geography: 35 units, including 102a-102b, 103a-103b,

413, 464, 469. To complete the remainder of the 35 minimum
required units, students may design their own concentrations or
may select one of four structured concentrations: geographical
applications and methods, people-environment interaction, urban
geography and planning, world regions and cultures. At least 18
units must be at the upper-division level.

The major in regional development: 35 units, including 102b, 110

supporting minor in economics, finance, real estate, marketing,
or general business is recommended.

A maximum of three units of internship (393) may be counted
toward either the major in geography or the major in regional
development.

Interdisciplinary studies majors may elect a geography or
regional development concentration; students may also minor in
geography or regional development.

The teaching major in geography: 30 units, including 151, 497a,
at least three units from 102a-102b, and at least four units from
