The School of Family and Consumer Resources provides
instructional, research, extension and outreach programs that
enable families, individual family members and consumers to
achieve an optimum quality of life throughout the lifespan.
Instructional programs prepare professionals for careers serving
families and consumers in a culturally diverse and rapidly
changing society.

The undergraduate program has as its major objectives: (1)
specialization in various aspects of Family and Consumer
Resources, in preparation for professional positions, and (2)
courses to enrich the professional preparation of students in
other colleges.

The school is organized into two divisions, Family Studies and
Merchandising and Consumer Studies, and two program areas,
Counseling and Guidance and Interior Design.

The school offers the Bachelor of Science in Family and Consumer
Resources with majors in family studies (emphasizing human
development, and interpersonal relations) or family life
education; family and consumer resources; home economics
education; interior design; and merchandising and consumer
studies.

Interior design is being phased out. No new majors are being
accepted. Faculty and some element of the interior design program
have been transferred to Architecture. Students interested in the
area should contact the College of Architecture.

Graduate degree programs offered by the School of Family and
Consumer Resources include the Master of Arts with a major in
counseling and guidance; the Master of Science with a major in
family and consumer resources or home economics education; the
Master of Education with a major in family and consumer
resources; and the Master of Home Economics Education with a
major in home economics education. For the Master of Science
degree with a major in family and consumer resources, and
concentrations are available in family studies; consumer studies;
merchandising; and home economics education. The school also
offers the Doctor of Philosophy with a major in family and
consumer resources. Emphases are available in consumer studies;
human development, interpersonal relationships and family
resource management. For further information, consult the
Graduate Catalog.

Students enrolled in majors in Family and Consumer Resources may
select a minor subject area with the approval of the student's
advisor.

Family and Consumer Resources (FCR)

The major in Family and Consumer Resources combines three
disciplines into a coherent and intellectually challenging major.
Designing the major requires that the student (a) prepare a
written proposal, (b) meet with an advisor, (c) have a final
proposal accepted, and (d) receive an advisor's signature. Each
student will select two subject areas (21 units each) from within
FCR. The student will select a third subject area within FCR or
outside of FCR. All applications must be submitted to an FCR
committee for approval.

Division of Merchandising and Consumer Studies (MCS)
S. Shim,  Chair

The Merchandising and Consumer Studies Division offers a program
of professional education preparing students for careers in the
fast changing merchandising institutions that serve families and
individual consumers in a global society. The purpose of the
undergraduate curriculum in the MCS major is to provide a broad
education to prepare the students not only for their professional
careers but also for their responsible citizenship and leadership
roles in society.

The MCS major coursework, concentrated in the upper-division
portion of the degree program, focuses on the effective and
efficient delivery of products and services to consumers through
four core components of the program; products and services
environment, business environment, visual and aesthetic
environment, and consumer and global environment.

Prior to the upper-division standing, students are encouraged to
complete a basic foundation of general education, including
course work in communications, mathematics, physical and
environmental science, arts, literature and language, the social
and behavioral sciences, and world civilization.

It is important for students to note that they are required to
meet the advancec upper-division standing requirement (a
cumulative grade-point average of 2.6 or above) in merchandising
and consumer studies to establish eligibility for the upper-
division level courses in the major. Also important is to note
the advanced standing requirements (a cumulative grade-point
average of 2.75 or above) required by the College of Business and
Public Administration to eestablish eligibility for the upper-
division level business courses.

Any course work that might be applicable to the upper-division
professional core or major requirements taken while enrolled in
other colleges or at other universities is subject to acceptance
by the School of Family and Consumer Resources for degree
certification purposes.

The major in merchandising and consumer studies: Majors must
complete five general education study areas, as described in the
College of Agriculture section of this catalog (see school
advising sheets for specific requirements for study areas); as
well as completing ENGL 101 or 103H; 102 or 104H; COMM 112; HE E
