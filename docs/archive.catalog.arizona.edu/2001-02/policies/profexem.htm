  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 align="left">Proficiency and Exemption Examinations</h3>
  <h4>General Information</h4>
  <p>A number of colleges and departments regularly offer exemption or
  proficiency examinations covering introductory or basic areas of their
  disciplines. These examinations are designed and graded by the individual
  departments. No credit is awarded on the basis of successful performance on
  these, but they allow a student two privileges: (a) the opportunity of
  enrolling in advanced-level courses in the area of proficiency; or (b) the
  opportunity of satisfying various college or departmental &quot;area&quot; or
  proficiency requirements without taking prescribed courses.</p>
  <p>Proficiency or exemption examinations for many courses are available to any
  student currently enrolled in a degree program at the university. Capable
  students wishing to increase their elective freedom are encouraged by
  university policy to examine the opportunities provided through the various
  proficiency examinations.</p>
  <p>At the discretion of the department, the proficiency examination may
  include laboratory projects or other evidence of satisfactory skills in
  addition to or instead of the written examination. A fee is normally charged
  for these examinations.</p>
  <h4>Second Language Proficiency Examinations</h4>
  <p>It is possible for students to satisfy <a href="secondlang.htm">second language requirements</a>
  in whole or in part by passing a non-credit proficiency examination at the two-
  or four-semester level<a href="profexem.htm#*">*</a>.</p>
  <p>Passing the proficiency examination at the required level in a foreign
  language fulfills the language requirement. Passing a course for which the required level is prerequisite also
  establishes proficiency in that language. Credit may not be earned merely by
  passing the proficiency examination.</p>
  <p>Foreign students will be allowed credit by transfer in their native
  language only for those courses taken during the years equivalent to the
  United States college years.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><a name="*">*</a>   Second language requirements vary by degree type. For specific language requirements consult the major department,
  college, or the <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">Academic
  Program Requirements Report (APRR)</a>  for a particular degree program.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4>Procedures and General Regulations</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Proficiency or exemption examinations are available only to
      degree-seeking students.</li>
    <li>In no case does passing an exemption or proficiency examination lower
      the total number of units required for the bachelor's degree.</li>
    <li>In normal circumstances, a student may not take a proficiency
      examination for the same course more than twice.</li>
    <li>Proficiency or exemption examinations are normally given early in the
      semester or during orientation. The student must contact the
      appropriate <a href="../dept/aaindex.html"> department</a> concerned for additional information and
      instructions.</li>
    <li>Students wishing to sit for a proficiency or exemption examination in a
      language not normally taught must contact the <a href="../dept/ling.shtml">Department
      of Linguistics</a> for information.</li>
    <li>The exemption or proficiency examinations are administered only on the
      University of Arizona campus.</li>
    <li>The results of exemption or proficiency examinations, if successful, are
      reported in writing directly to the Office of Curriculum and Registration, with a copy
      to the student.</li>
    <li>The student's academic record will be annotated with a statement
      indicating the student passed the proficiency examination at the
      appropriate level.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3><a name="specialexam">Special Examinations for Credit or Grade</a></h3>
  <p>Any student currently enrolled or previously withdrawn in good standing at
  the University of Arizona may earn credit toward an undergraduate degree
  through the use of special examinations. The responsibility for preparatory
  study for these examinations rests entirely with the student; faculty members
  are under no obligation to assist with such preparation.</p>
  <p>Special examinations are constructed and administered by the <a href="../dept/aaindex.html"> department</a>
  concerned. They are designed to reflect and explore the scholastic equivalent
  of the course, and are more comprehensive than the usual &quot;final
  exam.&quot; The examinations may be written or oral, or both, and they may
  include course projects, laboratory projects, written reports, or other
  evidence of proficiency.</p>
  <p>Undergraduate courses currently offered by the University and designated in
  the Catalog as &quot;<b>Special exam:</b>&nbsp; course may be taken by special
  exam for credit (not for grade).&quot; may be taken for credit by examination.&nbsp;
  Courses
  designated &quot;<b>Special exam:</b>&nbsp; course may be taken by special
  exam for credit and grade.&quot; may be taken for grade by examination and credit by
  examination. Other courses generally have been excluded from this option; at
  department discretion, however, any course may be made available for grade by
  examination or credit by examination.</p>
  <p><strong>Options</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Special Examination for <b>Credit</b>:&nbsp; Passing grades, recorded as
      &quot;CR&quot; (credit), become a permanent part of the student's record
      but are not used in computing the cumulative grade average. Failing grades
      are not recorded.</li>
    <li>Special Examination for <b>Grade</b>:&nbsp; All grades, whether passing or
      failing, are permanently recorded and used in computing the cumulative
      grade average.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
  <p>The credit so earned may not duplicate units already presented for
  admission to the University. Nor may the credit be in a course which is
  equivalent to, or more elementary than, another course in which the student is
  enrolled or for which the student has already received credit. The head of the
  examining department has the responsibility of determining the application of
  this limitation in each student's case.</p>
  <p>No credit may be earned by this type of examination for beginning or
  intermediate language courses in the native language of the applicant.</p>
  <p><strong>Procedures</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Applications for Special Examination for Credit or Special Examination
      for Grade may be obtained from the Office of Curriculum and Registration.</li>
    <li>The application must be approved by the student's advisor.</li>
    <li>The examining instructor and the head of the examining department must
      determine the eligibility of the applicant and sign the application.</li>
    <li>The application is returned to the Office of Curriculum and
      Registration, and the $21-per-unit fee
      is paid to the University Cashier. No department may schedule a special
      examination until notified by the Cashier that the fee has been paid.</li>
    <li>The examination is scheduled by the faculty member responsible, normally
      during the same semester in which the application is made.</li>
    <li>The grade (&quot;CR&quot; or letter grade) is reported to the Office of Curriculum and
      Registration. The
      examination, together with the student's graded examination paper and any
      appropriate evaluations of oral performance or projects, is then filed
      with the department for at least one year.</li>
    <li>The student may change the type of special examination for those courses
      designated &quot;available by special exam for credit and grade&quot; in the catalog any time before the scheduled
      hour of the examination by filing a new application. No additional fee
      will be charged.</li>
  </ol>
