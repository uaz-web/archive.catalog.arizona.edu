<h2 align="center">FAMILY AND CONSUMER RESOURCES</h2>

<h3 align="center">(FCR /RCS /FS ) </h3>

<p>The School of Family and Consumer Resources provides instructional, research, extension
and outreach programs that enable families, individual family members and consumers to
achieve an optimum quality of life throughout the lifespan. Instructional programs prepare
professionals for careers serving families and consumers in a culturally diverse and
rapidly changing society. </p>

<p>The undergraduate program has as its major objectives: (1) specialization in various
aspects of Family and Consumer Resources, in preparation for professional positions, and
(2) courses to enrich the professional preparation of students in other colleges. </p>

<p>The school is organized into two divisions, Family Studies and Retailing and Consumer
Studies. </p>

<p>Graduate degree programs offered by the School of Family and Consumer Resources include
the Master of Science with a major in family and consumer resources or home economics
education; the Master of Education with a major in family and consumer resources; and the
Master of Home Economics Education with a major in home economics education. For the
Master of Science degree with a major in family and consumer resources, and concentrations
are available in family studies; consumer studies; retailing; and home economics
education. The school also offers the Doctor of Philosophy with a major in family and
consumer resources. Emphases are available in consumer studies; retailing; human
development, interpersonal relationships and family resource management. For further
information, consult the <i>Graduate Catalog</i>. </p>

<p>Students enrolled in majors in Family and Consumer Resources may select a minor subject
area with the approval of the student's advisor. </p>

<h3>Family and Consumer Resources (FCR) </h3>

<p>The major in Family and Consumer Resources combines three disciplines into a coherent
and intellectually challenging major. Designing the major requires that the student (a)
prepare a written proposal, (b) meet with an advisor, (c) have a final proposal accepted,
and (d) receive an advisor's signature. Each student completes two subject areas (21 units
each) from within FCR. The student completes a third subject area outside of FCR. All
applications must be submitted to an FCR committee for approval. </p>

<h4>Division of Retailing and Consumer Studies </h4>

<p>The major in retailing and consumer studies (RCS) focuses on business theory and
practices of providing consumer products and services through retail channels with an
emphasis on meeting consumer interests and needs. </p>

<p>Students in the retailing and consumer studies major study the whole spectrum of the
industry including retailing of fashion soft goods, food and other consumer goods and
services. Three supplemental, specialized certificate programs are available, in food
retailing, international retailing and visual merchandising. </p>

<p>Course work for the major, concentrated in the upper-division portion of the degree
program, focuses on the effective and efficient delivery of products and services to
consumers through four core components of the program; products and services environment,
business environment, visual and aesthetic environment, and consumer and global
environment. </p>

<p>Prior to the upper-division standing, students are encouraged to complete a basic
foundation of general education, including course work in communications, mathematics,
physical and environmental science, arts, literature and language, the social and
behavioral sciences, and world civilization. </p>

<p>It is important for students to note that they are required to meet the advanced
upper-division standing requirement (a cumulative grade-point average of 2.6 or above) in
retailing and consumer studies to establish eligibility for the upper-division level
courses in the major. Also important is to note the advanced standing requirements (a
cumulative grade-point average of 2.75 or above) required by the College of Business and
Public Administration to establish eligibility for the upper-division level business
courses. </p>

<p>Any course work that might be applicable to the upper-division professional core or
major requirements taken while enrolled in other colleges or at other universities is
subject to acceptance by the School of Family and Consumer Resources for degree
certification purposes. </p>

<p><i>Certificate Programs:</i> Under the Southwest Retail Center, three certificate
programs can be completed in conjunction with, or in addition to , one's major field of
study. </p>

<p>The certificate program in international retailing is designed to expose students to
topics affecting international retail businesses and to provide a broad understanding of
multicultural businesses and social issues affecting retailers in selected regions of the
world. Students can choose a specialization in one of the following world regions: Latin
America and Mexico, Europe or the Pacific Rim. The program is designed for retailing and
consumer studies majors and non-majors. Students must have completed a foreign language
prerequisite consisting of a minimum of eight to 10 semester hours in a foreign language
appropriate for one of the three major world regions identified above. </p>

<p>The food retailing certificate program is designed to provide students an opportunity
to explore a career in the food retailing industry. This program is highly recommended
for, but not limited to, students in retailing and consumer studies, agricultural and
resource economics, nutritional sciences and marketing. Students are encouraged to apply
for the program at the beginning of the second semester of their sophomore year. </p>

<p>The visual merchandising and display certificate program will provide retailing and
consumer studies majors with the opportunity to complement their program of study in
retailing with a concentration of creative design courses in art, theater arts and
retailing and consumer studies. This program will prepare students in the optimum
presentation of merchandise. It will be of value and benefit to those graduates who have
responsibility to sell merchandise or who are concerned about the concept to be sold or
the image to be projected. </p>

<p>For additional information about the certificate programs, and for specific
requirements, consult the Division of Retailing and Consumer Studies. </p>

<h4>Division of Family Studies </h4>

<p>The major in family studies focuses on generation and dissemination of basic and
applied knowledge concerned with human development and family relations throughout the
life span. Students may elect courses in consultation with faculty members to reflect an
emphasis in human development or interpersonal relations. The major in family and consumer
sciences education leads to certification for teaching life management in public schools;
concentrations in secondary education and family life education are available. Candidates
for admission to undergraduate programs in family and consumer sciences education must
present evidence of having completed 56 units of work applicable to the Bachelor of
Science degree. Family and consumer sciences education
majors will not be allowed to register for 300- or 400-level family and consumer sciences
education or College of Education courses until successful completion of the writing
proficiency exam.<!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><msnavigation border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
