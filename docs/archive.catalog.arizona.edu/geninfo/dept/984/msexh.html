<p>Materials science is the science of the structure, properties and behavior of metals,
semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials. The materials scientist
strives to expand knowledge of the properties of existing materials and to develop new
materials. </p>

<p>Materials engineering emphasizes the fundamental knowledge necessary to select,
process, and apply materials for societal needs. The materials engineer strives to
transform materials for practical use. </p>

<p>More than one-fourth of all scientists and engineers are involved in the science or
engineering of materials, indicating that almost every field in science and engineering
uses materials. Recognizing the importance of materials in nearly every aspect of
technology, the University of Arizona has committed its resources to expanding the
Department of MSE. A wide range of courses, covering the many facets of MSE, is now
offered at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. </p>

Materials science and engineering is the study of the structure, processing and properties
of materials. The field covers the behavior of metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers,
semiconductors and composites. The curriculum in MSE includes an unusually large number of
elective courses, which can be taken both inside and outside MSE. This is a reflection of
the interdisciplinary nature of the field.<br>
<br>
All students in MSE are required to take the ten core courses, which cover the fundamental
principles of MSE. Based upon a student's interests, an appropriate sequence of elective
courses is decided upon with a faculty advisor in the sophomore year. Involvement in
active research programs is an important part of undergraduate education in MSE. While
participation is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged, and students are urged to seek
out faculty and arrange for projects as early in their undergraduate careers as possible.
The MSE curriculum prepares students for employment in materials research, development,
and production. Graduates are also prepared for graduate study in the many facets of
materials science and engineering.</font></a></p>
