<p>The Department of Linguistics offers instruction in introductory, intermediate, and

advanced topics in phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. It also offers course

work in Native American languages of the Southwest (e.g., Navajo and Tohono O'odham) and

courses on the native languages of North America. Undergraduate majors in linguistics are

prepared to undertake professional graduate studies in linguistics and related areas or to

pursue careers in such language related fields as education, publishing, and certain

sectors of business.</p>



<p><i>The major for the Bachelor of Arts:</i> In addition to required linguistics courses,

students are required to take one year of an uncommonly taught language. Majors are urged

to continue their foreign language study beyond the minimum required by the college.</p>



<p>Although the linguistics major does not depend heavily on numerical and quantitative

skills, mathematics training is a significant benefit for understanding many areas in the

discipline, as well as for graduate study in linguistics and many other fields. Therefore,

the linguistics department recommends that prospective majors complete MATH 110 (or an

equivalent).</p>
