<p align="left"><a name="deg">Aerospace engineering is concerned primarily with solving

the problems of flight, and places special emphasis on the design and operation of all

types of aircraft, rockets, satellites, and spacecraft. In recent years, aerospace

engineers have also become involved in the design of deep-submergence vehicles, modern

surface<br>

ships, air cushion vehicles, and ground transportation systems.<br>

<br>

Equipment supporting aerospace engineering studies includes digital computers with

interactive graphics; internal combustion engines; microcomputers and microprocessors;

nonlinear control systems; production and tooling shop; low and high-speed wind tunnels;

refrigeration and heat transfer loops; and instrumentation of a wide variety.</a></p>

<p><a name="deg"><font size="3">Mechanical engineering is a broad discipline which covers

the fields of solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and engineering design. Basic

studies are devoted to machine dynamics, fluid flow, energy and power systems, mechanical

properties of materials, and instrumentation. Students can specialize in a wide variety of

topics, which include power systems, thermal sciences, automatic controls, reliability and

quality assurance, mechanical design and manufacturing. Equipment supporting mechanical

engineering studies includes digital computers with interactive graphics; internal

combustion engines; microcomputer and microprocessors; nonlinear control systems;

production and tooling shop; low- and high-speed wind tunnels; a laser-doppler

velocimeter; refrigeration and heat transfer loops; instrumentation of a wide variety, and<br>

a materials test apparatus.</font></a>
