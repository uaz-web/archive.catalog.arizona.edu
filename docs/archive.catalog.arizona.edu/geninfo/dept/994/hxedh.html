<h3 align="center">Departmental Information</h3>
<h2 align="left"><small>HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAM (H ED)</small></h2>
<p>The department offers programs leading to the Master of Arts and Doctor of
Philosophy degrees with a major in higher education and the Doctor of Education
degree with a major in educational leadership.</p>
<p>Concentrations are available within graduate majors offered in the
department. The major in higher education is offered through the Center for the
Study of Higher Education, with concentrations in academic administration,
student personnel services administration, finance and business affairs
administration, community college administration, curriculum and instruction,
higher education policy making, and institutional research and planning.</p>
<p>The department also offers certification in educational administration.
Students seeking institutional recommendation for Arizona administrative
certification should major in educational leadership. In the Center for the
Study of Higher Education, master's degree programs may be designed to meet the
requirements for the Arizona Community College Teaching Certificate (Type A1a)
or for entry-level administrative service in institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>An undergraduate grade-point average of at least 3.00 is required for
admission to full standing in a graduate degree program. However, applicants
with undergraduate grade-point averages of 2.50 to 2.99 may be admitted on a
provisional basis. Standardized test scores also are required (e.g., GRE,
Millers Analogies). Beyond these minimal requirements, applicants must also meet
the specific requirements for all majors offered in the department. The meeting
of standards does not guarantee admission.
