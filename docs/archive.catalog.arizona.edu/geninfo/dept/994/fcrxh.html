<h3 align="center">Departmental Information</h3>
<h3 align="left">SCHOOL OF FAMILY AND CONSUMER RESOURCES (FCR /RCS /FS )</h3>
<p>The School of Family and Consumer Resources provides instructional, research,
extension and outreach programs that enable families, individual family members
and consumers to achieve an optimum quality of life throughout the lifespan.
Instructional programs prepare professionals for careers serving families and
consumers in a culturally diverse and rapidly changing society.</p>
<p>The undergraduate program has as its major objectives: (1) specialization in
various aspects of Family and Consumer Resources, in preparation for
professional positions, and (2) courses to enrich the professional preparation
of students in other colleges.</p>
<p>The school is organized into two divisions, Family Studies and Retailing and
Consumer Studies.</p>
<p>Students enrolled in majors in Family and Consumer Resources may select a
minor subject area with the approval of the student's advisor.</p>
<h4>Division of Retailing and Consumer Studies</h4>
<p>The major in retailing and consumer studies (RCS) focuses on business theory
and practices of providing consumer products and services through retail
channels with an emphasis on meeting consumer interests and needs.</p>
<p>Students in the retailing and consumer studies major study the whole spectrum
of the industry including retailing of fashion soft goods, food and other
consumer goods and services. Three supplemental, specialized certificate
programs are available, in food retailing, international retailing and visual
merchandising.</p>
<p>Course work for the major, concentrated in the upper-division portion of the
degree program, focuses on the effective and efficient delivery of products and
services to consumers through four core components of the program; products and
services environment, business environment, visual and aesthetic environment,
and consumer and global environment.</p>
<p>It is important for students to note that they are required to meet the
advanced upper-division standing requirement (a cumulative grade-point average
of 2.6 or above) in retailing and consumer studies to establish eligibility for
the upper-division level courses in the major. Also important is to note the
advanced standing requirements (a cumulative grade-point average of 2.75 or
above) required by the College of Business and Public Administration to
establish eligibility for the upper-division level business courses.</p>
<p>Any course work that might be applicable to the upper-division professional
core or major requirements taken while enrolled in other colleges or at other
universities is subject to acceptance by the School of Family and Consumer
Resources for degree certification purposes.</p>
<p><i>Certificate Programs:</i> Under the Southwest Retail Center, three
certificate programs can be completed in conjunction with, or in addition to ,
one's major field of study.</p>
<p>The certificate program in international retailing is designed to expose
students to topics affecting international retail businesses and to provide a
broad understanding of multicultural businesses and social issues affecting
retailers in selected regions of the world. Students can choose a specialization
in one of the following world regions: Latin America and Mexico, Europe or the
Pacific Rim. The program is designed for retailing and consumer studies majors
and non-majors. Students must have completed a foreign language prerequisite
consisting of a minimum of eight to 10 semester hours in a foreign language
appropriate for one of the three major world regions identified above.</p>
<p>The food retailing certificate program is designed to provide students an
opportunity to explore a career in the food retailing industry. This program is
highly recommended for, but not limited to, students in retailing and consumer
studies, agricultural and resource economics, nutritional sciences and
marketing. Students are encouraged to apply for the program at the beginning of
the second semester of their sophomore year.</p>
<p>The visual merchandising and display certificate program will provide
retailing and consumer studies majors with the opportunity to complement their
program of study in retailing with a concentration of creative design courses in
art, theater arts and retailing and consumer studies. This program will prepare
students in the optimum presentation of merchandise. It will be of value and
benefit to those graduates who have responsibility to sell merchandise or who
are concerned about the concept to be sold or the image to be projected.</p>
<p>For additional information about the certificate programs, and for specific
requirements, consult the Division of Retailing and Consumer Studies.</p>
<h4>Division of Family Studies</h4>
<p>The major in family studies focuses on generation and dissemination of basic
and applied knowledge concerned with human development and family relations
throughout the life span. Students may elect courses in consultation with
faculty members to reflect an emphasis in human development or interpersonal
relations. The major in family and consumer sciences education leads to
certification for teaching life management in public schools; concentrations in
secondary education and family life education are available. Candidates for
admission to undergraduate programs in family and consumer sciences education
must present evidence of having completed 56 units of work applicable to the
Bachelor of Science degree. Family and consumer
sciences education majors will not be allowed to register for 300- or 400-level
family and consumer sciences education or College of Education courses until
successful completion of the writing proficiency exam.<!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><msnavigation border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
