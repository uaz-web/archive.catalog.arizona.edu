<p>Materials science is the science of the structure, properties and behavior of metals,

semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials. The materials scientist

strives to expand knowledge of the properties of existing materials and to develop new

materials. </p>



<p>Materials engineering emphasizes the fundamental knowledge necessary to select,

process, and apply materials for societal needs. The materials engineer strives to

transform materials for practical use. </p>



<p>More than one-fourth of all scientists and engineers are involved in the science or

engineering of materials, indicating that almost every field in science and engineering

uses materials. Recognizing the importance of materials in nearly every aspect of

technology, the University of Arizona has committed its resources to expanding the

Department of MSE. A wide range of courses, covering the many facets of MSE, is now

offered at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. </p>

<h3><a name="deg">(ABET Accredited) </a></h3>



<p><a name="deg"><font size="3">Materials science and engineering is the study of the

structure, processing and properties of materials. The field covers the behavior of

metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, semiconductors and composites. The curriculum in MSE

includes an unusually large number of elective courses, which can be taken both inside and

outside MSE. This is a reflection of the interdisciplinary nature of the field.<br>

<br>

All students in MSE are required to take the ten core courses, which cover the fundamental

principles of MSE. Based upon a student's interests, an appropriate sequence of elective

courses is decided upon with a faculty advisor in the sophomore year. Involvement in

active research programs is an important part of undergraduate education in MSE. While

participation is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged, and students are urged to seek

out faculty and arrange for projects as early in their undergraduate careers as possible.

The MSE curriculum prepares students for employment in materials research, development,

and production. Graduates are also prepared for graduate study in the many facets of

materials science and engineering.</font></a></p>
