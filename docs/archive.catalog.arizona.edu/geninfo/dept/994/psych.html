<h2 align="left"><small>PSYCHOLOGY (PSYC)</small></h2>

<p>The Department of Psychology offers courses that provide a scientific understanding of
the biological, cognitive and social processes involved in behavior and mental life,
including normal and abnormal processes.</p>

<p><font size="3">Bachelor of Arts</font> majors complete a common core of psychology
courses.&nbsp; Majors must also complete at least one course in each of the following
three areas:&nbsp; Psychobiology and Neuroscience, Cognition, Emotion and Motivation, and
Individual and Social Processes.&nbsp; Students must take one Writing-Emphasis Course at
the 400 level, and may include up to three units of practicum or independent study as part
of their major.</p>

<p><font size="3">Bachelor of Science</font> majors are required to complete all of the
B.A. requirements, plus course work in a biological laboratory science in chemistry or
physics and additional mathematics courses. <font size="3">See the <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">APRR for the
B.S. in Psychology</a> degree for course requirements.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Each undergraduate program in Psychology also requires a minor. &nbsp;
Students pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology may select any minor from among
the list of approved University <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">minors</a>. &nbsp;
Students planning to attend graduate school in Psychology should consider pursuing the
Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology.&nbsp; Students pursuing a B.S. are required to
select a minor in one of the following areas: &nbsp; Biochemistry, Computer Science,
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Mathematics, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Physics, or
the Pre-Health Professions minor.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Note: </strong>The Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology is
considered a &quot;Science Intensive major&quot; and as such, students who pursue the B.S.
in Psychology are exempt from taking some specific Natural Science General Education
courses.&nbsp; All students pursuing the B.S. in Pshyhology are required, however, to
fulfill an 8 unit biological laboratory science requirement in addition to (or as a part
of) a minor in one of the previously mentioned areas.&nbsp; These 8 units will fill the
Tier One Natural Science requirements.&nbsp; For students selecting a minor in MCB, ECOL,
BIOC, or Pre-health Professions, these 8 units will be filled by courses in the minor.
&nbsp; For students selecting a minor in C SC, MATH, or PHYS, there are specific suggested
courses to take.&nbsp; Please contact the departent office for details.&nbsp; Tier Two
Natural Science requirements will be met by a course in the minor for students selecting a
minor in MCB, ECOL, BIOC, PHYS, and Pre-Health Professions.&nbsp; Students selecting a
minor in C SC or MATH will be required to complete a Tier Two Natural Science course.</font>
