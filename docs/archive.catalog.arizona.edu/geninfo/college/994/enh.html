<p><a name="intro"><b>Introduction</b></a></p>
<p>Engineering education is preparation for a professional career. While most
graduates embark on careers in engineering practice, men and women with
engineering majors find the baccalaureate program excellent preparation for
other fields as diverse as law, medicine, business and government. An
engineering education develops analytical and quantitative thinking, a critical
but optimistic approach to problem solving, and the habit of self-directed
future learning. Graduates make successful transitions to a wide variety of
different careers. The graduate has a thorough understanding of how materials,
energy, and information can be adapted to humanity's needs and desires. This is
developed through the study of physical science, mathematics, engineering
science, engineering design, humanities, social science and practice.</p>
<p><a name="Admissions"><b>Entrance Requirements</b></a></p>
<p><font size="3">In addition to University admission requirements, applicants
are required to present 1/2 unit of trigonometry. It is strongly recommended
that one unit of physics and one unit of chemistry be presented. Students
transferring into the college must have cumulative grade-point averages of 2.500
for all previous college work. Applicants must be ranked in the upper 25 percent
of the high school graduating class; or have achieved a grade-point average of
3.0 on a 4.0 scale; or a composite score of 23 (24 for out-of-state applicants)
on the ACT; or a minimum combined score of 1050 (1110 for out-of-state
applicants) on the SAT.</font></p>
<p><a name="Advanced Standing"><b>Advanced Standing</b></a></p>
<p><font size="3">Students must have been granted advanced standing to enroll in
300- or 400-level courses in the College of Engineering and Mines. The criteria
for achieving advanced standing are available in Room 200 of the Engineering
Bldg., in <a href="endept.html">departmental
offices</a>, or on the </font><img src="../../../images/images1999/unofficial-sm.gif" width="15" height="16"><font size="3">

<p><a name="General_Education_Program"><b>General Education Program</b></a></p>
<p><font size="3">All undergraduate students are required to complete a general
education program. Designed to provide a foundation for university learning, the
program develops students&#146; creative and analytical skills and integrates
knowledge across university disciplines. General education requirements for
engineering students are available in the <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">Academic
Program Requirements Report (APRR)</a> associated with each degree program, in
Engineering 200, in departmental offices, </font><font size="3">or on the
college home page.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Because of the prerequisite content of engineering curricula,
for advising purposes degree requirements are presented in a
semester-by-semester program that can be completed in 4 years. Four-year plans
for the undergraduate degrees are available in Engineering 200, in departmental
offices, or on the college home page.</font></p>
<p><b>Academic Advising</b></p>
<p>Visit your advisor every semester. Academic advisors are assigned by
contacting the departmental offices.</p>
<p><b>College of Engineering and Mines Freshman Honors Program</b></p>
<p>This program recognizes the abilities and achievements of high school
graduates and offers a variety of special challenges and resources to encourage
the full development of academic and interpersonal skills.&nbsp; Freshman honors
students are strongly encouraged to register for ENGR 196A and 196B.</p>
<p><b>Accreditation and the Curricular Content Required for Engineering Degrees</b></p>
<p>The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is the official
agency for accrediting undergraduate engineering degrees. For more information
about ABET requirements, contact the college's Office of Academic Affairs at
621-6032.</p>
<p><b>Scholarships</b></p>
<p>A limited number of scholarships are recommended each year by departments
within the College of Engineering and Mines. Students interested in applying for
these scholarships should contact their departmental offices for information. It
is usually best to do this prior to March 1.</p>
<p><b>Student Professional and Honorary Societies</b></p>
<p>Contact department or view the college Web site.</p>
<p><b>Multicultural Engineering Program</b></p>
<p>The Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP) is an academically-based student
support program for ethnic minorities and women. For additional information,
please contact Ray Umashankar, MEP Director, (520) 621-8103, Engineering
Building, Room 200 or see the college Web site.</p>
<p><b>Graduate Study</b></p>
<p><font size="3">For information about graduate programs consult the <a href="http://grad.arizona.edu">Graduate
Catalog</a><em> </em>or the college office.</font></p>
<p><b>Career Preparation</b></p>
<p>It is recommended that all engineering students participate in a career
experience prior to graduation. This experience can be gained by a full-time
cooperative education work experience, a part-time internship in a local
company, part-time or summer career employment, or a research experience in a
faculty member's laboratory. Information is available through the Academic
Affairs Office in Room 200, Engineering Building.</p>
