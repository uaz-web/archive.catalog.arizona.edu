<p><strong>Academic Policies </strong><font color="#FF0000">(Added March 26,
1999)</font><font size="2"></p>
<p></font><font size="3">No more than 48 units within the major may be applied
toward the BA or BS degree. That applies to Honors courses in the major and
courses cross-listed with an academic committee or center. Excluded from the
48-unit rule are freshman composition, the first year (elementary) of a foreign
language (see department headings for exceptions) and courses cross-listed with
a second academic department if the latter is the home department.</font><font size="2"></p>
</font>
<h3><small>General Education Program</small></h3>
<p><font size="3">All undergraduate students are required to complete a common
general education program. Designed to provide a foundation for university
learning, the program develops students&#146; creative and analytical skills and
integrates knowledge across university disciplines.</font></p>
<h3><small>General Advising</small></h3>
<p>Each department in the College of Humanities has major advisors that are
available to answer your questions regarding admission to the major,
registration planning, transfer credit, internships, and degree checks.</p>
<p>General education advising for all majors takes place in the College of
Humanities Academic Advising Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advising center also provides information about college and University
policies and procedures, declaration of major and minor, student-initiated
petitions, student academic progress, and educational decision-making.</p>
