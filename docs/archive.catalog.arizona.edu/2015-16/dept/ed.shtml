  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The College of Education offers teacher preparation for
  people seeking bachelor's degrees, for individuals who have already earned a bachelor's
  degree and seek state teacher certification, and for those who wish to earn a
  master'sdegree while preparing for certification. Separate programs prepare
  professionals to teach in early childhood education (birth to age 8/grade 3) 
  and elementary/middle school (1-8).. There is also an undergraduate program in cross-categorical special
  education.&nbsp; Master'sprograms in special education are offered as well. Programs include 
  at least one
  semester of supervised student teaching. The early childhood and elementary programs for
  undergraduate and post-baccalaureate students also include three semesters, 
  including student teaching, of
  field-based study that takes place in a Tucson-area elementary school. All 
  students seeking certification also receive an endorsement in Structured 
  English Immersion. Those seeking elementary certification may receive a 
  bilingual endorsement or an English as a Second Language endorsement instead 
  of the Structured English Immersion endorsement.</p>
  <p><b>
	Undergraduate Admissions</b></p>
  <p>The College of Education is an upper-division college, providing
  undergraduates with course work at the junior and senior level only (300-499).&nbsp;
  Undergraduates normally apply for admission to the College at the end of their
  sophomore year, after two years at a two- or four-year institution as
  pre-education majors.&nbsp; If enrolled at The University of Arizona,
  pre-education majors are administratively housed in the College of Education.&nbsp; All students seeking admission to the College of Education
  are strongly encouraged to consult an academic advisor in the Office of
  Student Services in the College of Education early in their college career.</p>
  <p>Pre-education majors generally complete their general education course work
  in the freshman and sophomore years.&nbsp; Students and advisors should
  consult the Degree / Academic Program Requirements Reports (APRRs) for
  specific general education and major requirements.</p>
  <p><b>Title II of the Higher Education Act</b></p>
  <p>The U.S. government requires that institutions preparing teachers report
  certain information about their programs to state and federal departments
  of education and the public.&nbsp; To view data from the most recent
  report filed by the University of Arizona, go to the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
