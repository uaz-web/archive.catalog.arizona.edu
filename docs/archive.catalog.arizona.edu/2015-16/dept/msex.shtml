<p>The Department of Materials Science
    and Engineering is in the <a href="en.shtml">College of
    Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>Materials science is the science of the structure, properties and behavior
  of metals, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials. The
  materials scientist strives to expand knowledge of the properties of existing
  materials and to develop new materials.</p>
<p>Materials engineering emphasizes the fundamental knowledge necessary to
  select, process, and apply materials for societal needs. The materials
  engineer strives to transform materials for practical use.</p>
<p>More than one-fourth of all scientists and engineers are involved in the
  science or engineering of materials, indicating that almost every field in
  science and engineering uses materials. Recognizing the importance of
  materials in nearly every aspect of technology, The University of Arizona has
  committed its resources to expanding the Department of MSE. A wide range of
  courses, covering the many facets of MSE, is now offered at both the
  undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>
<p><b>B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering
  (ABET Accredited)</b></p>
<p>Materials science and engineering is the study of the structure, processing
  and properties of materials. The field covers the behavior of metals,
  ceramics, glasses, polymers, semiconductors and composites. The curriculum in
  MSE includes an unusually large number of elective courses, which can be taken
  both inside and outside MSE. This is a reflection of the interdisciplinary
  nature of the field.<br><br>All students in MSE are required to take the 13 core courses, which cover the
  fundamental principles of MSE. Based upon a student's interests, an
  appropriate sequence of elective courses is decided upon with a faculty
  advisor in the sophomore year. Involvement in active research programs is an
  important part of undergraduate education in MSE. While participation is not
  mandatory, it is highly encouraged, and students are urged to seek out faculty
  and arrange for projects as early in their undergraduate careers as possible.
  The MSE curriculum prepares students for employment in materials research,
  development, and production. Graduates are also prepared for graduate study in
  the many facets of materials science and engineering.
