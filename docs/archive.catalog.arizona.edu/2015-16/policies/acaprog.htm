		return to the University.</p>

		Undergraduate students will be considered to be making normal progress

<b>Minimum Grade-Point-Average (GPA) Required for <a name="Continued"> Continued</a> Enrollment</b>

		One of the

		is that they earn a minimum cumulative grade-point-average (GPA) of 
		2.000.</p>

		Undergraduate students 
		not meeting the standards of normal progress will be placed on academic 
		probation. Probation status occurs following any term (i.e., fall, winter, 
		spring, summer) when the student'scumulative grade-point-average (GPA) drops below a 2.000.  
		Students on academic probation are subject to such 
		restrictions with respect to courses and extracurricular activities as 
		may be imposed by the academic dean of the college in which the student 
		is enrolled. Contact your
		<a  href="../dept/aaindex.html">
		college</a> dean's office for college-specific probation policies.&nbsp; 
		Students are removed from probation upon earning the minimum 2.000 cumulative GPA that is required by the University.</p>

  <b><a name="College Disqualification">College Disqualification</a>:</b>
  		<p>
	
		Undergraduate disqualification is of two types: from a particular college in the 
		University or from the University. A student may be academically 
		disqualified only after two consecutive regular semesters of not meeting 
		the standards of normal progress (cumulative grade-point-average of 
		2.000) or under conditions described below under &quot;Probation or 
		Disqualification by Special Action&quot;.&nbsp; Contact your
		<a  href="../../2005-06/dept/aaindex.html">
		college</a> dean's office regarding college disqualification policies.</p>
		<p>
		The student 
		recommended for disqualification from a particular college may seek 
		immediate admission to another college in the University. Permission for 
		admission to another college must be obtained in writing from the dean 
		of the college into which the student plans to transfer. The letter of 
		permission should be presented to the Office of the Registrar. 
		Ordinarily, permission will be granted only if the student plans to 
		pursue a modified program in a curriculum of the new college and has 
		demonstrated ability warranting such action. Those who have been given 
		college disqualification are strongly urged to seek thorough academic 
		and career counseling and guidance. Failure to secure approval to 
		transfer to another college in the University is tantamount to 
		University disqualification, and the rules governing this type of 
		disqualification then will apply. A disqualified student may not attend 
		the University as a non-degree student.</p>
		<p>
		A student 
		disqualified from a particular college who may have secured subsequent 
		permission to register in another college is automatically on academic 
		probation in the new college. Students may be granted college 
		disqualification only once in their academic career. Any later 
		disqualification will be considered a University disqualification.</p>
  <b><a name="University Disqualification">University Disqualification</a>:</b>
  		<p>
		An undergraduate student 
		who receives University disqualification is restricted from registering 
		at the University of Arizona and may return to the University only on 
		the basis of evidence that underlying conditions have materially 
		improved and that he or she is now capable of academic success. Students 
		seeking readmission who left the University on academic probation or 
		under disqualification must receive approval from the dean of the 
		college they wish to enter prior to readmission..</p>
  <b>Probation or Disqualification by Special Action:</b>
  <p>
Upon 
	recommendation of the dean of the college, an undergraduate may be placed on 
	academic probation or may be disqualified at any time for neglect of 
	academic work.</p>
  <b>Credit Restrictions for Undergraduates With a University
  Disqualification:</b>
  <p>
	Students who 
	are under disqualification from the University may not take University of 
	Arizona courses for credit or establish credit by examination during their 
	periods of disqualification, although they may remove incomplete grades.
