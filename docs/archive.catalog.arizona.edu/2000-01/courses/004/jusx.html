 Women in Ancient Israel
 </b> (1-3)  I II This course is an intensive investigation of the life of the ancient Israelite woman.  It presents a multidisciplinary approach toward reconstructing the social, economic, religious and political life of women in Iron Age Israel.  Through readings and class discussion, students will explore the ways in which women contributed to their society throughout the eras of the Judges and of the United and Divided Monarchies (1200-587 BCE).
Because women traditionally have been undervalued and marginalized, until recently little attention was devoted to this vitally important and stimulating topic.  In consequence, students will be challenged to utilize mulitple sources in their reconstruction of the lives of Israelite women.  The sources used in this class will include (but not be limited to) archaelogical, historical and art historical data, the witness of the Hebrew Bible and other pertinent texts, and anthropological and ethnographic studies of the roles of women in preindustrial and Middle eastern societies.
