<B><A NAME="scholarships"></A>SCHOLARSHIPS AND FINANCIAL AID GENERAL
INFORMATION</B> 
<P>
The University of Arizona offers an outstanding array of private
donor scholarships to the most talented and brightest students.
Students may apply for consideration using the scholarship application
form within the undergraduate admissions materials. Awards from
over 1,500 different scholarship accounts provide more than $14
million annually on a competitive basis. Selection criteria vary
and may include factors such as the student's proven academic
excellence, talent, current major or degree program, leadership,
and service record.
<P>
Students are encouraged to conduct their own search for nationwide
scholarships, using printed or computer based scholarship search
materials, available in libraries. On the campus, a &quot;Fund
Finder&quot; automated database can be viewed in the Scholarship
Office in Old Main, or printed materials are available in the
Main Library. The extraordinary variety of awards require separate
applications to the funding agencies and foundations that supply
the scholarships themselves.
<P>
The University of Arizona provides access to a full range of federal,
state, and privately donated financial aid funds to its students
through the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA). Assistance
is available to students based on financial need, academic merit,
and program of study. The application process for financial aid
begins with the completion of a need-based application for student
financial aid. In addition, the University of Arizona Scholarship
Application must be completed to apply for scholarships.
<P>
In 1994-95, the Office of Student Financial Aid administered $175
million in aid, which assisted 23,608 students at the University.
Many awards are competitive, so early application is urged. Students
should <I>apply as soon as possible after January 1 of each year
in which they expect to receive financial aid</I>. The application
forms are widely available from high school counselors, community
colleges and the OSFA. If you are transferring from another institution
and applying for financial aid, you must also submit a Financial
Aid Transcript.<A NAME="federal"></A> 
<P>
<B>FEDERAL AID PROGRAMS</B> 
<P>
Federal aid programs comprise over 75 percent of the total aid
available through The University of Arizona. For undergraduate
students, the base of funding begins with the Federal Pell Grant
Program. For graduate students, the Federal Stafford Loan usually
is the first source of funding.
<P>
<I>FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GRANTS-</I>The Federal
SEOG Program is a direct grant to undergraduate students demonstrating
exceptional financial need. Eligibility is determined by the Office
of Student Financial Aid.
<P>
<I>FEDERAL COLLEGE WORK STUDY-</I>The Federal College Work Study
Program allows students to defray part of their cost of education
through work experience. Many job placements are career related,
offering both valuable experience and income to the student. The
recipient may work up to 30 hours per week in an on-campus or
off-campus placement.
<P>
<I>FEDERAL PELL GRANTS-</I>The Federal Pell Grant Program is funded
by the federal government in order to provide primary access for
students for their undergraduate degrees. Eligibility is established
by the federal government and students are funded appropriately
to their dependency status, living accommodations, and enrollment.
<P>
<I>FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOANS-</I>This Program is available
to both graduates and undergraduates to meet educational expenses.
Loans are made by local lending institutions, including banks,
credit unions, and other financial institutions. The loans are
federally insured for repayment and lenders are paid a subsidy
on the interest rate as long as the student is enrolled in school.
For the unsubsidized loan, interest begins to accrue immediately
after the loan is made. Repayment begins six months after the
borrower is no longer enrolled in school at least half time and
continues over a five to ten year repayment period. Students must
complete a need-based application form to determine eligibility.

<P>
<I>FEDERAL PERKINS LOANS-</I>The Federal Perkins Loan allows students
to borrow for undergraduate or graduate education at five percent
interest. The amount of the loan is determined on the basis of
financial need and repayment begins six months after the borrower
is no longer enrolled in school. Loan recipients are required
to sign promissory notes agreeing to honor the terms and conditions
of their loans. Various deferment provisions for community service,
unemployment, or economic hardship are available.
<P>
<I>PARENT LOANS FOR STUDENTS-</I>The federal PLUS program is available
to undergraduate students. The interest rate (capped at 9%) is
variable and begins 60 days after the loan is taken. Students
whose families show no financial need can participate in these
programs. A separate application is required.
<P>
The loans listed in this section can be considered for consolidation
into a single repayment by qualified agencies. Contact OSFA for
details.<A NAME="institute"></A>
<P>
<B>INSTITUTIONAL STUDENT AID</B>
<P>
Various departments on campus employ students in non-work-study
positions to perform a variety of functions. The employing department
decides on the selection of the student. Student financial aid
recipients must be aware that institutional earnings from all
sources are required to be reported to the Office of Student Financial
Aid. In limited circumstances, students' financial aid packages
may require adjustment in order to coordinate the earnings with
other aid offers.
<P>
<I>SHORT-TERM LOANS-</I>The short-term loan program is intended
to assist students with short-term funding problems or emergencies.
The loans must be repaid within the semester or session borrowed.
The loans are usually for a period of 45 days or until the last
day of class, which ever comes first. At the start of a semester
the period is usually shortened to provide maximum assistance.
Deferments are provided during the fall and spring semesters for
those students whose need has been determined but aid has not
arrived.
<P>
All students are encouraged to apply for financial aid, regardless
of their parents' financial status. The broad range of financial
aid resources available to the Office of Student Financial Aid
provides access on a variety of levels. Students who do not have
financial need may still qualify for academic scholarships, temporary
loans, or other programs. Therefore, please feel free to contact
the Office of Student Financial Aid for further information at
(520) 621-1858.
