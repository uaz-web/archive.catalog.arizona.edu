<B>THE GRADUATE COLLEGE</B>
<P>
<B><A NAME="intro"></A>THE NATURE OF GRADUATE WORK</B>
<P>
The status of graduate students is different from that of undergraduates.
Satisfying degree requirements should not be the primary aim of
graduate students. Graduate education provides an opportunity
to increase knowledge, to broaden understanding and to develop
research capabilities. Consequently, a student's academic achievements
should reflect a personal commitment to the discipline and to scholarly standards.
<P>
<B><A NAME="adm"></A>ADMISSION</B>
<P>
Admission to the Graduate College is open to qualified applicants
who hold the bachelor's degree from The University of Arizona
or from a college or university which grants degrees recognized
by The University of Arizona. Degrees that are recognized should
be based on programs of study that meet or exceed the general
education requirements for comparable degree majors at The University
of Arizona. A degree cannot ordinarily be recognized if it is
based on any of the following types of credits:
<P>
1. Credits awarded by postsecondary institutions in the United
States that lack candidate status or accreditation by a regional
accreditation association.
<P>
2. Credits awarded by postsecondary institutions outside the United
States that lead to degrees considered not equivalent to the U.S.
bachelor's degree, or that lack recognition by the home country's
Ministry of Education.
<P>
3. Credits awarded by postsecondary institutions for life experience
unless validated by the institution awarding the credits through
the use of standardized (such as CLEP) or comprehensive examinations.
<P>
4. Credits awarded by postsecondary institutions for courses taken
at noncollegiate institutions (e.g., governmental agencies, corporations,
industrial firms, etc.).
<P>
5. Credits awarded by postsecondary institutions for noncredit
courses, workshops, and seminars offered by other postsecondary
institutions as part of continuing education programs.
<P>
In general, degrees that are recognized should be based on a unit
of credit comparable to that defined by the Arizona Board of Regents
(26 May 1979) for institutions under its jurisdiction. A minimum
of 45 hours of work by each student is required for each unit
of credit. An hour of work is the equivalent of 50 minutes of
class time (often called a &quot;contact hour&quot;) or 60 minutes
of independent study work. For lecture-discussion courses, this
requirement equates to at least 15 contact hours and a minimum
of 30 hours of work outside of the classroom for each unit of
credit. Even though the values of 15 and 30 may vary for different
modes of instruction, the minimum total of 45 hours of work for
each unit of credit is a constant. Admission is granted only after
approval of an applicant's previous academic record by the Dean
of the Graduate College and the head of the academic unit in which
the greater portion of major academic work will be completed.
<P>
<B>Grade-Point Average</B> 
<P>
Applicants who apply for admission to the Graduate College are
evaluated on the individual merits of their academic achievements
and individual scholarly potential to complete graduate level
course work and curriculum requirements. Ordinarily, a minimum
cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 over the last 60 units of
course work is required for admission to the Graduate College.
Applicants should consult the academic unit to which they are
applying regarding that unit's grade-point average expectations.
Prospective students who do not meet this standard may enroll
as non-degree students and complete 12 con- secutive units of
500-level (or higher) course work with a grade-point average of
a least 3.25 in order to establish eligibility for seeking admission
to the graduate degree program of their choice.
<P>
<B>Graduate Record Examination (GRE)</B> 
<P>
Normally applicants must submit scores on the Graduate Rec-ord
Examination in order to complete the admission process. Scores
on the aptitude test of the Graduate Record Examination are used
to supplement other evidence of preparation for graduate work.
Such scores are only one component of the credentials used to
make admission decisions, and they are evaluated in the context
of the complete record of each applicant. No formal minimum scores
on standardized examinations are required for admission to the
Graduate College. A number of departments, however, have specific
requirements with regard to the Graduate Record Examinations,
the Graduate Management Admissions Test, or other examinations.
Some may require applicants to take the advanced GRE in the appropriate
discipline. Academic departments and departmental headnotes in
the Graduate Catalog should be consulted for further information.
It is important that the examination is taken as early as possible
in the academic year. Applications for the examinations, which
are administered locally as well as in other centers, should be
sent, together with the examination fee, to Graduate Record Examinations,
Educational Testing Service, Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541-6000.
<P>
<B>Regular Graduate Status</B> 
<P>
Students who meet the admission requirements outlined above may
be admitted to Regular Graduate Status to undertake work leading
to an advanced degree.
<P>
<B>Admission with Deficiencies</B> 
<P>
An additional number of undergraduate courses may be required
when previous work has not approximated the general requirements
for the corresponding bachelor's degree at The University of Arizona
or the special requirements for the field in which the candidate
proposes to specialize. With departmental approval, a limited
number of course deficiencies may be satisfied after admission
to a graduate program; however, this work will not receive graduate
credit.
<P>
<B>Provisional Admission</B> 
<P>
Provisional admission indicates some reservation on the part of
the Graduate College with regard to the applicant's qualifications
to undertake graduate work leading to an advanced degree. This
restriction does not, however, impair the student's opportunity
to earn graduate credit in properly selected courses. If admitted
provisionally, a student who then completes nine credit hours
of graduate work with superior grades will be in good standing,
subject to any additional requirements established by the major
department or academic unit. Students admitted provisionally because
they lack only GRE scores may request conversion to Regular Graduate
Status immediately upon the receipt of the scores in the Graduate
College and may have the requirement to complete nine credit hours
of graduate work waived. Students on provisional status who wish
to be admitted to Regular Graduate Status should obtain the &quot;Provisional
to Regular Graduate Status Request Form&quot; from the Graduate
College and follow the directions on the form. Only students in
Regular Graduate Status can be awarded a degree.
<P>
<B>Graduate Nondegree Status</B> 
<P>
Individuals holding a bachelor's degree, or its equivalent from
a college or university which grants degrees recognized by The
University of Arizona may attend graduate-level courses without
being admitted to a graduate degree program. Such students may
enroll in graduate-level course work as their qualifications and
performance permit; however, no more than 12 units earned while
in this status may later be applied toward an advanced degree
awarded at the University.
<P>
<B>Admission of International Students</B> 
<P>
Nonimmigrants should request graduate application forms from the
Graduate Admissions Office and departmental requirements and materials
from the major academic unit. <I>All international student applications,
with required credentials, must reach the Graduate Admissions
Office before February 1 for summer and fall terms and August
1 for the spring term. </I>International applicants may apply
for a deferment of their application processing fee until enrollment
if they are from Hungary, Liberia, Poland, Tunisia, Zimbabwe or
the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States. All other
international applicants must submit a $35.00 processing fee with
their application.
<P>
<B>International Special Status</B> 
<P>
Some graduates of foreign institutions may be admitted initially
as International Special Students for a period of enrollment limited
to two academic terms with the understanding that they may be
required to undertake some work without graduate credit in order
to make up deficiencies in preparation. In any event, no commitment
can be made regarding the time required to complete a course of
study.
<P>
Students admitted to this status are full-time students, taking
a minimum of nine units of credit per semester. Those units may
be in appropriate courses at either the undergraduate or graduate
level. At the conclusion of the student's first semester in residence,
the Graduate College and the academic unit to which the student
seeks admission will evaluate the student's progress. If the academic
unit recommends a change to Regular Graduate Status, the student
can receive graduate credit for all graduate eligible work taken
during the first semester in residence. If Regular Graduate Status
is not recommended, a final evaluation of the student's progress
will be conducted following the student's second semester in residence
in International Special Status. Students admitted to Regular
Graduate Status can receive graduate credit only for the graduate
eligible units taken during the one semester immediately preceding
the award of Regular Graduate Status. It is the responsibility
of the student to initiate the request to change to Regular Graduate
Status. Forms are available in the Graduate Degree Certification
Office, Administration Building, 316.
<P>
<B>Proficiency in English</B> 
<P>
The University requires all applicants whose native language is
other than English to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language
(TOEFL) unless they have completed at least two academic years
of full-time study or received a bachelor's or higher degree at
a post-secondary academic institution in which English is the
spoken tongue and medium of instruction. The TOEFL must be taken
no more than two years prior to the date of admission. Scores
will be sent to The University of Arizona, when requested by the
applicant, from TOEFL, Box 899-TR, Princeton, NJ 08540, U.S.A.
The scores for this examination must be received before the student's
application is complete. A minimum, composite score of 550 is
required by the Graduate College. Some departments require a higher
score. Students whose native language is not English and who wish
to be considered for a teaching assistantship must also submit
scores on the Test of Spoken English (TSE) that is also administered
by the Educational Testing Service of Princeton, NJ 08540, or
the SPEAK test available at The University of Arizona.
<P>
For those prospective students who lack college-level English
proficiency, the Center for English as a Second Language (CESL)
offers full-time English language training on campus. The full
semester or summer term sessions carry no college credit, but
satisfactory completion of CESL training meets the University's
English proficiency requirement for admission. Further information
can be requested from the Center for English as a Second Language,
Room 104 CESL Building, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721.
<P>
<B>Financial Resources for International Students</B> 
<P>
Students on nonimmigrant visas must certify that they possess
adequate financial resources to support themselves while in residence
at The University of Arizona. If sponsorship is through an organization
or government agency, the sponsor must inform the Graduate Student
Admissions Office, in advance, what the terms of support will
be. Financial guarantees must be dated and addressed to The University
of Arizona. If the University is to bill for tuition and fees,
billing must be through an embassy or an agent in the United States.
An official letter regarding billing information must be sent
to The University of Arizona Bursar's Office, SUPO Box 21042,
Tucson, AZ 85720. In addition, students on nonimmigrant visas
are required by the University to have student accident and sickness
insurance coverage for each term of enrollment. The cost of this
insurance is included in the amount of financial guarantee required.
International students and family members on nonimmigrant visas
may be required to obtain health insurance through The University
of Arizona. In addition, international students may be required
to have a TB screening test at the Student Health Service prior
to registering for classes at the University. Information pertaining
to insurance and TB screening will be forwarded to all international
students upon admission to the University.
<P>
<B>Application for Admission</B> 
<P>
Application for admission to the Graduate College must be made
on forms furnished by the Graduate College. New applicants should
submit one set of complete official transcripts/degree certificates
of <I>all</I> undergraduate and graduate work <I>with the Graduate
College application. Each transcript must be in its original,
sealed envelope.</I> All applications and supporting documents
should be sent to the Graduate Admissions Office, University of
Arizona, Administration Building, Room 322, Tucson, Arizona 85721-0001.
Credits which appear as transfer credits on any other transcript
are not valid; applicants must submit an official transcript from
the school where the credits were earned. Applications and required
credentials for domestic applicants must be submitted to the Graduate
Admissions Office before June 1 for fall term and October 1 for
spring term. Applicants are urged to have all materials submitted
well in advance of the above dates. Submission of the application
and materials up to one year in advance is recommended. Applicants
whose records are not in English are required to provide a certified
translation of their records. Applicants should also contact the
department of their intended major to obtain departmental application
materials and requirements.
<P>
Students who have been admitted to the Graduate College but who
were not enrolled during the previous regular semester must reapply
for admission. (See the<I> Graduate Catalog</I> for exception
to this policy.) All material becomes the property of the Graduate
College and will not be returned.

<B><A NAME="off"></A>OFFICE OF GRADUATE INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAMS</B>
<P>
Graduate interdisciplinary programs have emerged in response to
recent changes in many domains of knowledge. They pool expertise
from traditional academic fields and embody the spirit of innovation,
the search for new knowledge, and the application of this knowledge
into new contexts. The need for interdisciplinary approaches,
in a wide spectrum of human endeavors, has been recognized by
the National Science Foundation, which states that &quot;many
of the challenges and opportunities today and into the next century
cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.&quot; Consistent with
this philosophy, interdisciplinary programs (IDPs) offer cutting
edge environments for training graduate students and, in a growing
number of cases, provide introductory undergraduate courses to
acquaint students with innovative opportunities in graduate education.
<P>
There are currently 19 IDPs at The University of Arizona in which
more than 680 members of the faculty participate. These faculty
members represent most colleges and 74 departments. Approximately
11% of graduate students are enrolled in IDPs, and in 1994 the
number of advanced degrees earned through IDPs has increased to
143, accounting for 15% of advanced degrees awarded at the University.
<P>
The Office of Graduate Interdisciplinary Programs is responsible
for furthering the development of ongoing and new activities in
these programs. Additional information concerning individual programs
may be obtained through this office (621-8368; 621-8367; 1010
N. Martin Street). The Director of the IDP Office reports to the
Dean of the Graduate College and the Vice President for Research.
Close interactions with college deans and department heads are
continuously nurtured to optimize participation of faculty in
interdisciplinary programs. Graduate interdisciplinary programs
are governed by interdisciplinary faculty committees appointed
by the Dean of the Graduate College.
