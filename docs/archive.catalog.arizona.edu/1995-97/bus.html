<B>COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</B> 
<P>
<B><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</B> 
<P>
The college offers professional education in both business and
public administration. Its purpose is to prepare men and women
for professional positions in the public and private sectors.
The college also provides continuing educational opportunities
for those seeking to improve their positions. Faculty of the college
are actively engaged in research on a wide range of economic and
administrative topics.
<P>
The college has been a member of the American Assembly of Collegiate
Schools of Business since 1948, and its undergraduate and graduate
curricula in business are accredited by the assembly. The college's
graduate program in public administration is recognized by the
National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration.
<P>
The college faculty offers a rich combination of experience in
professional management problems and practices, scholarship, teaching
and research. Many members serve as consultants in industry, government,
health care, education and transportation. Several faculty members
have authored texts which are widely used in management education
throughout the United States. In addition, the faculty is well
represented on the editorial boards of major professional publications.
<P>
The college includes the Karl Eller Graduate School of Management;
School of Public Administration and Policy; and the following
departments: Accounting; Economics; Finance; Management and Policy;
Management Information Systems; and Marketing.
<P>
<B><A NAME="deg"></A>DEGREE PROGRAMS</B> 
<P>
<B>Undergraduate Degrees</B> 
<P>
Two undergraduate degrees are offered by the college: the Bachelor
of Science in Business Administration (B.S.B.A.), and the Bachelor
of Science in Public Administration (B.S.P.A.). The structures
and purposes of the two degrees are similar. Both provide a strong
foundation in the arts and sciences in the freshman and sophomore
years. In each, the common body of knowledge necessary for effective
management is thoroughly explored. Through the major, a comprehensive
exposure to a particular field is obtained. Finally, there is
the opportunity to enroll throughout the undergraduate years in
courses outside the field of administration.
<P>
<B>Undergraduate Majors</B> 
<P>
Within the B.S.B.A. degree program, students may select a major
in accounting, business economics, entrepreneurship (competitive
entry), finance, general business administration, human resource
management, management information systems, marketing, or operations
management. An International Business Certificate Program (competitive
entry) also is available to undergraduates. Within the B.S.P.A.
degree program, students may select a major in criminal justice
administration, health and human services administration, or public
management.
<P>
Students may elect to take a second major from among those offered
in their degree program. The general business administration major,
however, may <I>not</I> be combined with another major. Students
selecting a second major must complete all the stipulated requirements
for each.
<P>
The majors offered in the college are more fully described below.
<I>Minor fields are not available in the college.</I> 
<P>
<B>Graduate Degrees</B> 
<P>
The Graduate College, through the Karl Eller Graduate School of
Management in the College of Business and Public Administration,
offers a number of graduate degrees for qualified students. These
include the Master of Business Administration; Master of Accounting;
Master of Arts degree with a major in economics; and Master of
Science degree with majors in finance, management and policy,
management information systems, and marketing. The School of Public
Administration and Policy, in conjunction with the Graduate College,
offers the Master of Public Administration. In conjunction with
the College of Law, combined programs for the Juris Doctor/Master
of Business Administration, Juris Doctor/Master of Arts with a
major in economics, and Juris Doctor/Doctor of Philosophy with
a major in economics are offered. Through cooperative agreement
between the College of Business and Public Administration and
the American Graduate School of International Management, a dual
degree program is offered which leads to a Master of Business
Administration from the University of Arizona and a Master of
International Management from the American Graduate School of
International Management.
<P>
The Doctor of Philosophy degree is offered with majors in management
and economics.
<P>
Detailed information on these programs is contained in the <I>Graduate
Catalog.</I> 
<P>
<B><A NAME="stu"></A>STUDENT ADVISEMENT</B> 
<P>
Students new to the college, whether just entering the University
or transferring from on-campus into the BPA College, should contact
the Undergraduate Programs Office, McClelland Hall 103, to make
an appointment for information and academic advising. Students
with prior college-level work should bring transcripts.Freshmen,
sophomores and all general business administration majors receive
academic advising by college advisors in the Undergraduate Programs
Office.Juniors and seniors in all majors except general business
administration are advised through the department offering the
major. Students should contact the department office to obtain
a major advisor.Information on all college baccalaureate degree
programs, policies and requirements can be obtained at the Undergraduate
Programs Office.
<P>
<B><A NAME="spe"></A>SPECIAL ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS</B> 
<P>
Incoming freshmen should present high school credit in mathematics
as follows: one unit of elementary algebra, 1/2 unit of intermediate
algebra, and 1/2 unit of advanced algebra.Transfer students from
community colleges must meet all freshman and sophomore requirements
as shown below for the degree they wish to pursue, either by acceptable
transfer credit or course work for University Credit.
<P>
<B>TRANSFER CREDITS</B> 
<P>
<B>General Statement</B> 
<P>
Undergraduate programs in business administration in universities
normally concentrate the professional courses in the last two
years of a four-year program. Only a limited amount of work in
business courses is offered prior to the junior year. The objective
of this policy is to permit the student to acquire a foundation
of work in the basic arts and sciences as a prerequisite for professional
courses in business.All business programs accredited by the American
Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business require the students
to take a minimum of 50% of the degree program in general education
courses, including work in economics, mathematics, social science,
statistics, humanities and the natural sciences. Students desiring
a four-year degree are advised to take a majority of their work
during the first two years in the arts and sciences, including
a strong background in mathematics.
<P>
Students planning to take their first two years of work at a community
college or at another four-year institution should take only those
courses in business that are offered as freshman- or sophomore-level
courses at any of the three state universities. These lower-division
courses are numbered 1 through 299. <I>A maximum of 30 units of
business and economics courses from community colleges will be
accepted toward a bachelor's degree in business administration.</I>

<P>
Professional business courses taught at the junior or senior year
in the three state universities may not be completed at a two-year
college for transfer credit in the business core or major (the
introductory course in the legal environment of business will
be accepted as lower-division credit as an exception to this policy).
Such courses may be utilized in the free elective category subject
to the 30-unit limitation. Courses taught as vocational or career
classes at the community colleges which are not taught in the
colleges of business at any of the three state universities will
not be accepted for credit toward a bachelor's degree. Courses
taught in the upper division business core at the three state
universities must be completed at the degree-granting institution
unless transferred from an accredited four-year school.
<P>
<I>Only 72 units of community college work may be applied toward
a BPA College degree program.</I> 
<P>
<B>Suggested Courses</B> 
<P>
The following general pattern of courses is recommended for students
completing their first two years' work in a community college
and planning to transfer to one of Arizona's universities without
loss of credit:

</pre>
<I>*A minimum of 51 upper division units is required. This should
be kept in mind in selecting general education courses.</I> 
<P>
<B>Upper-Division Business Courses</B> 
<P>
The college accepts transfer credit in upper-division business
courses only from schools or colleges whose programs are accredited
by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business. Policies
regarding transferable units vary among universities. For further
information, see &quot;Transfer Students&quot; in the <I>Admission
to the University</I> section of this catalog.
<P>
<B><A NAME="adv"></A>ADVANCED STANDING POLICY</B> 
<P>
The Advanced Standing Policy restricts all enrollments in upper-division
(300- and 400-level) courses taught by the departments in the
BPA College during the fall and spring semesters to those who
qualify either as BPA, non-BPA, or exempt program students or
by catalog exemption. During presession, winter session and the
summer sessions, upper-division BPA courses may be taken without
Advanced Standing with the permission of the Undergraduate Programs
Office. Students seeking permission must have at least junior
status and meet course/program prerequisites.
<P>
All undergraduate students seeking to register for the restricted
upper-division courses offered by the BPA College must make application
and have their eligibility established. Information and application
forms are available in the Undergraduate Programs Office, McClelland
Hall 103.
<P>
In general, permission to register for the restricted courses
is granted subsequent to receipt of complete documentation of
a student's eligibility. Thus, evidence of completion of course
requirements being taken elsewhere, or by correspondence, of total
units, or of the attainment of the requisite University grade-point
average is required before permission to register is granted.
Conditional permission to register for restricted courses is granted
only to BPA students who are completing any outstanding requirements
in residence and whose grade-point average meets the current eligibility
level.
<P>
Ineligible students enrolled in any of the restricted courses
will have their enrollment cancelled. All students are responsible
for their own registrations and for having established their eligibility
for any of the courses covered by the Advanced Standing Policy.
<P>
Students admitted to BPA by transfer from another college at The
University of Arizona are subject to all of the provisions of
the advanced standing policy in effect at the time of their acceptance
into BPA. They must be enrolled in the college at least one fall
or spring term prior to graduation to be eligible to receive the
B.S.B.A. or the B.S.P.A. degree.

Writing-Proficiency Examination (UDWPE) once they have accumulated
at least 40 units of credit.
<P>
Accordingly, BPA students applying for Advanced Standing must
provide either evidence of completion of the UDWPE or evidence
of having registered to take the UDWPE. In the latter case, any
subsequent registration for upper-division BPA courses will be
contingent upon having completed the examination as scheduled
and prior to the next registration period.
<P>
<B><A NAME="pre"></A>PRESCRIBED CURRICULUM FOR BACHELOR OF SCIENCE
