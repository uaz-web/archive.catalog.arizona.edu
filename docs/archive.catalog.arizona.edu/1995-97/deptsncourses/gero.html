Because of its multidisciplinary nature, gerontological studies
serves several educational purposes. At the undergraduate level,
students in Arts and Sciences may minor in gerontology or select
gerontology as one of the three subject areas in the interdisciplinary
studies major. Graduate students may pursue a Master of Science
with a major in gerontology, a doctoral minor or a graduate certificate
in gerontology. In addition to these formally structured academic
programs, gerontological studies plays a facilitating role in
the coordination and development of aging studies and will guide
students interested in incorporating a gerontological emphasis
into their own chosen field.
<P>
The undergraduate arts and sciences minor consists of 20 units;
the interdisciplinary studies major subject area requires 24 units.
A gerontological studies advisor is available to aid the student
in the selection of courses.
<P>
The doctoral minor requires 15 units and is particularly appropriate
for students in areas such as education, administration, policy,
social welfare, health, nutrition and other disciplines in the
social and behavioral sciences.
<P>
The Graduate Gerontology Certificate Program offers formal recognition
for gerontological study in an 18-unit structured course of graduate
study that offers a foundation of gerontological knowledge and
theory and an opportunity for the application of knowledge through
field work. The program is designed to supplement an undergraduate
or graduate degree. It is particularly appropriate for individuals
planning to enter or to continue in a profession that involves
provision of services and/or administration of programs for the
aged, and is well-suited for the working adult. Fifteen units
of coursework and 3 units of internship are required. A 3.0 grade-point
average is necessary for admission.
<P>
The 48-unit Master of Science with a major in gerontology is comprised
of 21 units of core courses, a concentration in a related field,
internship and electives. Students may elect to complete a thesis
or a master's project. Each student's study plan is individually
designed to meet the student's special interests and professional
objectives. Applicants to the Master of Science program must submit
scores from the Graduate Record Exam, three letters of recommendation
and a statement of intent. For full standing, a 3.0 grade-point
average is required.
<P>
Many courses in the curriculum are offered in other departments.
These include: EXSS 566, FS 413, 613, 636; PA 424/524, 427/527;
PSYC 421, 521, 427/527; SER 455/555. Courses originating in gerontological
studies and courses cross-listed with gerontology include:
