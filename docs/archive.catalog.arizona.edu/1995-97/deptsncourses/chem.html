<P>
The Department of Chemistry provides both general and professional
training, giving a strong foundation upon which to base a career
in the fields of medicine and related health sciences, in secondary
education, or leading to industrial work or graduate specialization
in chemistry.
<P>
The degrees of Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts with a
major in chemistry, and Bachelor of Science in Education with
a teaching major in chemistry are offered. A Master of Arts, Master
of Science and Doctor of Philosophy with a major in chemistry
are also available, as is a Master of Education with a major in
chemistry.
<P>
<I>The major for the B.S.</I>: The Bachelor of Science degree
in chemistry is for students planning careers as professional
chemists and is also the degree for students planning on post-graduate
study in chemistry. The curriculum for the B.S. degree meets the
professional requirements for a degree approved of the American
Chemical Society. The following courses are required: 103a-103b
and 104a-104b, or 105a-105b and 106a-106b; 241a-241b or 242a-242b;
245a-245b; 325; 326; 396 or 396H; 400a-400b; 404; 405; 412; 424;
480a-480b; and at least six additional units in chemistry chosen
from the following, three of which must be laboratory courses:
402, 407, 440, 446, and 460 or 462a-462b; or as approved by a
chemistry advisor. Students planning to pursue careers as practicing
chemists are encouraged to fulfill the foreign language requirement
with German, Russian, or Japanese.
<P>
All students are strongly encouraged to participate in undergraduate
research through enrollment in CHEM 199, 299, 399, or 499. Consult
a chemistry advisor for additional information on this program.
The major in chemistry assumes substantial knowledge of mathematics.
MATH 124, 125b, and 223; and PHYS 104a-104b and 180a-180b are
prerequisite to courses in the major. Completion of the above
math and physics courses meets the requirements for a math-physics
split minor. Other minors may be chosen with the approval of the
chemistry advisor.
<P>
<I>The major for the B.A.</I>: The Bachelor of Arts degree in
chemistry is intended for students who do not plan to pursue post-graduate
study in chemistry and are planning on a non-laboratory career.
The degree affords a broader exposure to chemistry than the B.S.
degree, and is intended for students needing this type of background
for careers in business, law, medicine, etc. Students following
the B.A. program may choose any language to satisfy the foreign
language requirement. The following courses are required: 103a-103b
and 104a-104b, or 105a-105b and 106a-106b; 241a-241b or 242a-242b;
243a-243b or 245a-245b; 325; 326; 396 or 396H; 405; 480a-480b
(or 481 in place of 480b); and one of the following pairs of courses:
462a-462b or 424-400a or 404-412.
<P>
The major in chemistry assumes substantial knowledge of mathmatics.
MATH 124 and 125b; PHYS 104a-104b and 180a-180b are prerequisite
to courses in the major for the B.A. At least two additional units
in mathematics or physics are needed to complete the Math-Physics
split minor. These units should be chosen in consultation with
the chemistry advisor.
<P>
<I>The chemistry minor:</I> 103a-103b, 104a-104b, or 105a-105b
and 106a-106b, and any additional chemistry courses at the 200
level or higher to give a minimum of twenty units of credit. At
least two of these additional units must be laboratory courses.
CHEM 296, 396, and 302 are not acceptable for the first twenty
units of the minor.
<P>
<I>The chemistry teaching major:</I> Students wishing to acquire
a B.S. degree in edu-cation with a teaching major in chemistry
enroll in Arts and Sciences as pre-education chemistry majors
for the freshman and sophomore years. In the sophomore year students
apply for admission and subsequently transfer to the College of
Education to complete their junior and senior years. Students
should consult with their chemistry advisor and also with a pre-education
advisor in the College of Ed-ucation to plan their course work.

<P>
The chemistry teaching major curriculum is designed to provide
depth in the fundamentals of chemistry as well as breadth in mathematics
and other basic sciences. Students following the teaching major
program should consider Spanish for the foreign language requirement.
The following courses are required: 103a-103b and 104a-104b or
105a-105b, and 106a-106b; 241a-241b or 242a-242b; 243a-243b or
245a-245b; 325, 326; 405; 433; and 480a-480b; MATH 124, 125b;
PHYS 104a-104b and 180a-180b; PHYS 433 or BIOC 433; MCB 181-182
or GEOS 101-102-103-104.
<P>
<I>The chemistry teaching minor:</I> 103a-103b and 104a-104b,
or 105a-105b and 106a-106b; 241a-241b or 242a-242b; 243a-243b
or 245a-245b; 325 or 322; 326 or 323. 433 is also recommended.
<P>
<I>The double major in chemistry and biochemistry:</I> A student
may earn a B.S. degree with majors in chemistry and biochemistry
by successful completion of the appropriate required courses.
Students seeking such a degree must consult with advisors in the
Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry to plan a suitable program.
<P>
<I>The double B.S. degree in chemistry and biochemistry:</I> A
student may earn B.S. degrees in both fields by successful completion
of the appropriate required courses. Students seeking these two
degrees must consult with advisors in the Departments of Chemistry
and Biochemistry to plan a suitable program.
<P>
The department participates in the honors program.
