<P>
The School of Health-Related Professions provides educational
opportunities for students interested in pursuing a wide range
of health-related careers in the University, community and commercial
sectors. Academic programs within the school offer strong, science-based
preparation for researchers, technicians, and teachers who will
advance knowledge to promote health, prevent disease, improve
the quality of life, and enhance human physical performance. The
school also provides course work for undergraduates who wish to
enter the professions of medicine and physical therapy or to prepare
for graduate study in the health science fields.
<P>
At the time this catalog was being edited, the School of Health
Related Professions and its major programs were undergoing review
and reorganization. All current and prospective students considering
application to one of the undergraduate or graduate majors offered
by the School should check with the academic advisors for that
major.
