Study of statistics enables one to model the uncertainty in data
and draw organized scientific conclusions from it. Data from different
disciplines post different statistical problems and hence statistics
is inherently an interdisciplinary field. The department offers
both theoretical and applied courses. Statistics is available
as a major in the Master of Science and the Doctor of Philosophy
degrees.
