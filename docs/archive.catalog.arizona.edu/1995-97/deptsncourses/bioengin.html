Biomedical engineering can be defined as a multidiscipline in
which physical scientists and engineers interact with life scientists
and physicians to solve problems ranging from basic biomedical
engineering research to applications in clinics and health care
delivery systems. The University Committee on Biomedical Engineering
coordinates options available to students in the College of Engineering
and Mines, and in other colleges.
<P>
Upper-division undergraduate students may select biomedical engineering
courses and projects as technical electives. Graduate students
working toward the Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy in
an engineering or life science department may select courses and
research topics in biomedical engineering as part of their minor
programs. No biomedical engineering degrees are offered.
<P>
Courses available in biomedical engineering are offered in several
departments in the Colleges of Agriculture, Business and Public
Administration, Engineering and Mines (for engineering minor programs)
and Medicine, and in Sciences and Social and Behavior Science.
Areas of emphasis include: biological imaging; biomaterials, biomedical
instrumentation; cardiovas-cular and respiratory mechanics and
transport; medical informatics and decision support systems; modeling
and simulation of health delivery systems, biological systems
and molecular and cellular systems; musculoskeletal biomechanics,
robotics and prosthetics; and neural networks.
<P>
For additional information contact Dr. Ralph Martinez (Electrical
and Computer Engineering/Radiology), Dr. Timothy Secomb (Physiology),
Dr. Bruce Simon (Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering), or Dr.
Stuart Williams (Surgery/Physiology).
