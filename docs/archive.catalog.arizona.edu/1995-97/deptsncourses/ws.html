<P>
Women's studies is an interdisciplin-ary academic program that
offers courses focusing on the new scholarship on women's experiences
and perspectives. The committee offers the Bachelor of Arts degree
with a major in women's studies.
<P>
The major allows students to specialize in courses focusing on
women and to pursue concentrated study in a supporting minor.
The student is required to take 30 credit hours: three required
courses 100, 200 and 305; one 200-level or 300-level course chosen
from 205, 225, 253a, 253b, 357; one course in multi-cultural perspective
chosen from either 406, 465, 468, 469, 485, 489, or 490,; and
five other upper-division women's studies electives, at least
one of which must be a Writing-Emphasis course (see &quot;Writing-Emphasis
Courses&quot; in the <I>Academic Guidelines</I> section of this
catalog).
<P>
The minor in women's studies consists of at least 20 units selected
by the student in consultation with the chairperson of the committee
and approved by the student's advisor. Students with a minor in
women's studies are encouraged to take courses sequentially, beginning
with W S 100, then taking intermediate-level courses, and finishing
with a senior seminar.
<P>
A major in women's studies provides a sound liberal arts preparation
for graduate or professional school. It is also useful for students
who wish to pursue careers in journalism, social work, or administration
of affirmative action with an emphasis on women's issues.
