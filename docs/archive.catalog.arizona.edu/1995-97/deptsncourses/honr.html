The Honors Center provides special opportunities for undergraduate
students who demonstrate the highest levels of curiosity, creativity
and academic achievement. Responsibility for the program is shared
between academic departments and the Honors Center. Departments
generally assume responsibility for those courses which are endemic
to their respective disciplines while the Honors Center participates
in this joint venture by offering seminars and colloquia that
are broader, often interdisciplinary in focus, and by exposing
students to a variety of noncredit, cultural opportunities designed
to enrich campus life.
<P>
In the <I>Schedule of Classes</I> students receive prior to registration,
all honors courses are identified by the suffix &quot;H&quot;
attached to the course number (History 106H) or to a section designation
positioned under the course number (History 106, section 5H).
Honors courses are reserved exclusively for honors students. 
<P>
In order to graduate with honors, a student must: (1) maintain
a 3.5 grade-point average, (2) complete 30 units in university-wide,
college, or departmental honors courses (18 units if entering
as a junior or senior), (3) complete both semesters of 498H as
part of the 30-unit honors requirement, and (4) submit a completed
honors thesis to the Honors Center prior to graduation. The format
of the program is structured such that a student can fulfill the
academic honors requirements by enrolling in at least one honors
course each semester, plus completing the required 498H sequence
(6 units).
<P>
Course offerings sponsored by the Honors Center and the participating
academic departments include, but are not limited to, those listed
below. It is important to note that, in order to develop an appropriate
blend of honors offerings, these courses may not be offered every
semester or year. Students should check the <I>Schedule of Classes</I>
each semester to determine if a specific course is available.
