<p>Students may maintain continuous enrollment whether attending a single public community
college or university in Arizona or transferring among public institutions in Arizona
while pursuing their degrees. Continuous enrollment status of a student and the catalog of
determination for a student are defined by: </p>

<p>A semester in which a student earns course credit will be counted toward continuous
enrollment. Non-credit courses, audited courses, failed courses, or courses from which the
student withdraws do not count toward the determination of continuous enrollment for
catalog purposes. </p>

<p>Students who do not meet the stipulated minimum enrollment standard during three
consecutive semesters (fall/spring) and the intervening summer term at any public Arizona
community college or university are no longer considered continuously enrolled, and must
meet requirements of the public Arizona community college or university catalog in effect
at the time they are readmitted or of any single catalog in effect during subsequent terms
of continuous enrollment after readmission. Students are not obligated to enroll and earn
course credit during summer terms, but summer enrollment may be used to maintain
continuous enrollment status.
