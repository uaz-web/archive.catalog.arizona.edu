<blockquote>
  <h3><small>Graduation Average</small></h3>
	<p><font color="#FF0000">(Policy update 1/29/08, clarifying grades to be 
	included)</font></p>
  <p>A graduation average of 2.000 for all University Credit course work 
	undertaken and for any work satisfied by the Special Examination for Grade 
	is required for the bachelor's degree. Note: The graduation grade average is 
	based only on University Credit grades awarded prior to the graduation date, 
	when all degree requirements have been satisfied.</p>
  <h3><small>Major Average</small></h3>
  <p>Majors for undergraduate degrees require an average of 2.000 or better for <i>all
  </i>University Credit work undertaken in the major field or for any work
  satisfied by the Special Examination for Grade if in the major.</p>
  <h3><small>Averaging of Grade for Final Non-university Credit Course</small></h3>
  <p>Students who lack not more than a one-semester course toward the
  fulfillment of curriculum and minimum-graduation-average requirements, may
  apply as the final course to complete the degree, a single one-semester course
  either in residence at another accredited institution or in correspondence
  work through The University of Arizona. Permission must be obtained from the
  academic dean, prior to enrolling for the course, to apply the grade received
  in such a course toward the graduation average. This provision may be applied
  also to the required separate average of 2.0000 in the major field if prior
  permission is obtained from the major professor and the academic dean.</p>
  <h3><small>University Credit Requirement</small></h3>
  <p>A minimum of 30 units of University Credit from The University of Arizona
  is required for the bachelor's degree. It is further required that 18 of the
  final 30 units offered toward the degree be University Credit. Various
  departments have specific University Credit requirements for their majors, and
  students should consult individual <a href="../../geninfo/dept/994/dept.html">departmental
  information </a>sections for this information. For a definition of University
  Credit, see the <a href="enrpol.htm">Credit Definitions and Enrollment
  Policies</a> page.</p>
  <h3><small>Upper-division Unit Requirement</small></h3>
  <p>The University of Arizona recognizes both breadth and depth of knowledge as
  important characteristics of a baccalaureate degree. To insure depth of study
  beyond introductory levels, the University has a general policy requiring
  students to complete a minimum of 42 units of upper-division course work for
  graduation. This requirement applies to students graduating under the 1991-93
  catalog or any subsequent catalog. The special requirements of some academic
  programs may necessitate an exception to this requirement. Some degree
  programs require fewer than 42 units of upper-division credit. For current
  information, students should consult their advisors, the <a href="../../geninfo/dept/994/dept.html">department</a>
  which offers their major, or the <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics"><font size="3">Academic
  Program Requirements Report (APRR)</font></a> for their major to determine if
  their degree program may require fewer than 42 units of upper-division credit.</p>
  <h3><small>Correspondence and Credit by Examination Credit Maximums</small></h3>
  <p>A maximum of 60 units toward a bachelor's degree may be earned through
  correspondence credit and/or credit by examination.</p>
