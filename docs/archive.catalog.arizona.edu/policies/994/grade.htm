  <p><b>Regular and Special Grades</b></p>
  <p>A, B, C, D, and E constitute the regular grades used at the University of

<p>S (superior) and P (pass)
grades are used in place of regular grades A and B,
respectively, for courses graded S, P, C, D, E and S, P, E, K.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S and
P grades are NOT included

<p><b>* NOTE:</b> For house numbered courses with a choice of grading systems (senior 
capstone, colloquium, etc.), an instructor may have the option of awarding 
regular grades only (A,B,C,D,E) or the combination of special and regular grades 
(S,P,C,D,E), as departmental policy dictates.&nbsp; However, in any single class 
offering, all registrants must be graded by the same system.</p>

	<p><b>Pass/Fail Option</b></p>
  <p>For certain courses, a qualified student may elect to register under the
  pass/fail option. Under such registration, the only final grades available to
  the student are P (pass) or F (fail).</p>
  <p>Undergraduate students may elect to take courses under the pass/fail option
  only after they have attained sophomore standing and only if they have earned
  grade-point averages of 2.000 or better.</p>
  <p>Students registering for a course under the pass/fail option must meet the
  prerequisites or otherwise satisfy the instructor of their ability to take the
  course.</p>
  <p>Undergraduate students may register under the pass/fail option for not more
  than two courses per semester up to a maximum of 12 courses. Further, they
  must carry a minimum of 12 units of regular grades other than P/F during each
  semester in which they elect courses under the pass/fail option. Any
  exceptions to this policy must be approved by the student's academic dean.</p>
  <p>Courses taken under the pass/fail option must be electives only, and may
  not be used to fulfill major, minor, or other specified curriculum
  requirements.</p>
  <p>The pass/fail option is not generally available to graduate students. The
  only exceptions to this proscription are: (a) admission deficiencies which the
  student has prior specific, written approval to take on a P/F basis (only the
  department head or the departmental graduate adviser may give such approval,
  which must be on file in the Graduate College office before registration); (b)
  any undergraduate non-deficiency course available for P/F grading; and (c) any
  course offered by the College of Law.</p>
  <p>Each department decides which of its courses will be available under the
  pass/fail option. Pass/fail courses in the 500, 600, or 700 series may be
  offered only in law. Further, the instructor of the course must approve of its
  being offered pass/fail. The instructor shall be informed by the Registrar
  which students are enrolled under the pass/fail option.</p>
  <p>Students may change from pass/fail enrollment to enrollment for a regular
  grade, or vice versa, only during the time period prior to the last day of the
  fourth calendar week during which classes are held, except with special
  permission of the student's college dean.</p>
  <p>If a course is taken under the pass/fail option, the grade of P or F will
  be permanently recorded. However, neither grade will be included in the
  average. If the course is passed, the units of credit will be applied toward
  graduation.</p>

	of Incomplete Grade</a> form as a contract with the student as to what 
	course work must be completed by the student for the <b>I</b> grade to be 
	removed and replaced with a grade. On the form, the instructor states:&nbsp; (1) 
	which assignments or exams should be completed and when; (2) how this work 
	will be graded; and (3) how the student's course grade will be calculated. 
	Both the instructor and student sign this agreement and both should retain 
	copies.</span></p>
	<p><span style="color:black">After the course work is completed, the

	<p><span style="color:black">If the incomplete grade is not removed by the

	converting to an E, the extension is approved by the instructor and the dean 
	of the college in which the student is registered. This extension requires 
	the instructor and dean's signature on a Petition for Extension of Course 
	Work.&nbsp; Notification of the dean's approval or denial is to be provided to 
	the student by the dean's office.&nbsp; A copy of the approved or denied Petition 
	must then be forwarded from the dean's office to the Office of the 
	Registrar, Administration 210, for appropriate processing.&nbsp; Once the <b>I</b><i>
	</i>has converted to an <b>E</b>, a one-year extension will only be 
	considered if the student submits an appeal to the University General 
	Petition Committee.&nbsp; Additionally, a request for an extension of time beyond 
	2 academic years of the original course enrollment requires approval by the 
	General Petition Committee.&nbsp; For courses taken for graduate credit, such 
	approval may be granted only by the Graduate College.</span></p>
  <p><b>Course in Progress</b></p>
  <p>The grade of K may be awarded by the instructor for 900-level courses when
  the course continues for longer than one semester. Students must re-enroll for
  these courses each semester. K grades remain on the student's permanent record
  until removed with a final grade but do not enter into the calculation of the
  grade-point average. Time-limit for completion of such work for full credit
  for the master's degree is six years; for the doctoral degree, ten years.</p>
  <p>The grade of K is assigned for all supplementary registration (930) at the
  time of enrollment and will remain permanently on the student's academic
  record.</p>
  <p>For any course, other than the 900 series, that requires more than one
  semester for completion, the grade of K is awarded by the Office of the
  Registrar at the end of the semester and carried to the next semester.</p>
  <h4><strong>Withdrawal Grade W:&nbsp; Dropping a Course</strong></h4>
  <p>Prior to the end of the fourth week of classes, official withdrawal (drop)
  of a course cancels the registration for the course. A dean’s approval is
  not required. No grade for the course will appear on the student’s permanent
  record. During weeks five through eight, the grade of W is awarded to students
  who are passing at the time of withdrawal. The grade of E may be awarded to
  students not passing at the time of withdrawal. Either W or E will show on the
  student’s permanent record.</p>
  <p>After the eighth week of classes, the grade of W can be awarded only with
  the approval of the student’s academic dean, and only under exceptional
  circumstances. The W may also be awarded in the case of complete withdrawal
  from the University.</p>
  <h4>Withdrawal Grades W/P, W/F:&nbsp; Complete Withdrawal from the University</h4>
  <p>In the case of complete withdrawal from the University, if a student
  withdraws before the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> week of classes in Fall/Spring
  (end of the 1<sup>st</sup> week in a Summer term), no classes show on the
  student's transcript for the semester/term. If a student withdraws from the
  University between the 5<sup>th</sup> week of classes in Fall/Spring (2<sup>nd</sup>
  week in a Summer term) and the last day of classes for the semester/term, the
  faculty member for each course may assign a grade of W/P (withdrawal while
  passing), or W/F (withdrawal while failing). Neither grade is used to
  calculate the GPA. The refund schedule is listed for each semester/term in the
  Schedule of Classes.</p>
  <p><b>Audit Grade</b></p>
  <p>The grade of O is awarded for courses taken for audit. This grade is not
  awarded unless the student is registered for audit.</p>
  <h4>No Grade Submitted</h4>
  <p>The grade of Y is issued to all students in a course whose instructor
  failed to meet the grade reporting deadline at the end of the term. This grade
  will not be issued to any student in a course if other students in the same
  course were awarded grades by the instructor.</p>
  <p><b>Averaging of Grades</b><font color="#FF0000"><br>
	(Policy updated 1/10/06)<i><br>
Wording 
change to clarify calculation of cumulative GPA</i></font></p>
  <p>For the purpose of computing grade-point averages, grade points are 
	assigned to each grade as follows: A, 4 points for each semester unit; B, 3 
	points; C, 2 points; D, 1 point; and E, 0 points. The grade-point-average is the arithmetic mean of the grade points earned for 
all credits taken at the University of Arizona for

University Credit</a> or by
<a href="../../2005-06/policies/profexem.htm#specialexam">
Special Examination for Grade</a>, where regular grades are awarded. Ordinarily 
cumulative GPAs are calculated using only the courses at the career level of the 
student. For example, the undergraduate GPA is based on undergraduate courses 
only (see <a href="../../2005-06/policies/enrpol.htm#gradcreditseniors">Graduate 
Credit for Seniors</a>,
<a href="../../2005-06/policies/gro2.htm">Grade Replacement 
Opportunity</a>, and

Renewal for exceptions</a>). </p>
  <p><b>Change of Grade</b></p>
  <p>Within one (1) year of the awarding of the grade, final grades may be
  changed by the instructor on a change-of-grade form, only if there has been an
  error in computation . The grade change must be approved by the head of the
  instructor's department.</p>
