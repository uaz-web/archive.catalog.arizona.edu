<blockquote>
  <p>General education programs provide breadth of knowledge as a balance and
  complement to the depth provided by the major. General education is designed
  to accomplish several goals: first, to afford students the opportunity to
  learn how different disciplines define, acquire and organize knowledge;
  second, to provide a basis for an examination of values; third, to develop
  analytic, synthetic, linguistic and computational skills useful for lifelong
  learning; and finally, to provide a common foundation for wide-ranging
  dialogue with peers on issues of significance. Taken together, the experiences
  of general education encourage the student to develop a critical and inquiring
  attitude, an appreciation of complexity and ambiguity, a tolerance for and
  empathy with persons of different backgrounds or values and a deepened sense
  of self. In short, the goal of the general education program is to prepare
  students to respond more fully and effectively to an increasingly complex
  world.</p>
  <p>The general education program at The University of Arizona is
  university-wide; that is, regardless of college or major, students hold their
  general education requirements in common.</p>

  <p>This component builds a foundation in certain skills that can be further
  developed in major courses and in Tier One and Tier Two general education
  courses. Foundations include a course in mathematics (the character of which
  will vary with the major), courses in composition, fourth-semester skill level
  in a second language for all students in B.A. degree programs, and
  second-semester skill level in a second language for all students in non-B.A.
  degree programs. (Students in engineering will satisfy the second language
  requirement by taking the placement examination at entrance to the
  University.)</p>
  <p>Each segment of this component may be satisfied, at least in part, by
  demonstration of proficiency as well as by course work.</p>
  <p><a name="MATH"><b>Mathematics Requirements
  </b></a></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#9C0800">(Policy updated on June 1, 2001:&nbsp; PHIL
  110 added to list of courses that require the MRT)</font></p>
  <p>MATH 105 (Math in Modern Society) or PHIL 110 (Logic
  and Critical Thinking) or any three-unit mathematics course numbered above
  MATH 105 is required of all students. The appropriate course for an individual student will depend on the
    student's major and the corresponding math strand chosen (see the
    descriptions of the <a href="gened.html#strands"> math strands</a> below).</p>

  <p>Registration in all mathematics courses below MATH
  129, as well as MATH 160, MATH 263, and PHIL 110 requires all students to take the UA
  Mathematics Readiness Test (MRT). Test scores are valid for one year.&nbsp;This requirement includes transfer students
  with or without mathematics credit and students with credit by examination,
  such as Advanced Placement, CLEP, or International Baccalaureate.&nbsp;The
  MRT is administered by the University Testing Office in Old Main, Room 223,
  (520) 621-7589.</p>
  <p>Students may register only for a course at or below
  the level placed into by their MRT score.&nbsp; Transfer credits in
  mathematics may be used in conjunction with the MRT score for placement
  purposes.&nbsp; In this case, students must contact the Mathematics Department
  for advising about placement.&nbsp; Transfer credits in mathematics and credit
  by AP, CLEP or IB do not exempt a student from taking the MRT in order to be
  eligible for the courses listed above.&nbsp; New freshmen with a reported RSAT
  1 mathematics score of at least 670 or an ACT mathematics score of at least 29
  may register for MATH 120R or lower, as well as MATH 160 and MATH 263, without
  taking the MRT.&nbsp; This waiver is only valid if the student begins taking
  mathematics courses during their freshmen year.</p>

  Readiness Test, math placement, or eligibility issues, visit the <font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="../../images/images1999/unofficial-sm.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"></font>

  <p><b><a name="strands">Math Strands:</a></b></p>
  <p>Entry-level mathematics students should choose one of three strands
  according to their interests, preparation, and intended major. All strands
  presume that students will have completed the high school math required for
  entry to the University.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The three strands are:</p>
    <p><strong>G (General Knowledge)</strong>  -- This strand involves a general 
	understanding and appreciation of how mathematics is used to solve problems 
	in everyday life; for example, the mathematics of voting and elections, or 
	of networks and paths. The G-strand does not prepare a student for any 
	further mathematically-based work:&nbsp; it is a terminal course. Only those 
	students whose major requires the most general knowledge of mathematics 
	would take this strand. The options for this strand are MATH 105 
	(Mathematics in Modern Society) and PHIL 110 (Logic and Critical Thinking). 
	To satisfy the mathematics requirement G-Strand, students must attain a 
	certain minimum score on the MRT.&nbsp; Each of these courses requires a 
	different score (see the chart provided on the
	<a href="http://www.math.arizona.edu/placement">Math Placement Homepage).</a></p>
    <p><strong>M (Moderate Knowledge)</strong>  -- The M-strand is for students
    who require mathematical facility at the level of at least MATH
    110
    (Collegiate Algebra). This strand involves reasonable facility with algebra
    and algebraic functions, graphs, and simple modeling. Students who choose
    the M-strand are prepared for further mathematical work. This work may
    include MATH 114 (Finite Mathematics), MATH
    113 (Elements of Calculus), or a
    statistics class from outside the mathematics department.</p>
    <p><strong>S (Substantial Knowledge)</strong>  -- This strand involves skill
    and facility with calculus. The S-strand begins at one of two calculus
    options - MATH 124 (Calculus I with Applications) or MATH
    125 (Calculus I).
    Students who successfully complete the S-strand may continue on to MATH
    129 (Calculus II), MATH 223 (Vector Calculus), or beyond. Those who choose but are not ready to begin the
    S-strand will be required to take preparatory work.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Each major indicates the mathematics strand that is most appropriate for
  its students. It is important to note that each strand provides a different
  level of mathematical training, but students can satisfy the mathematics
  requirement in their major by completing a more advanced mathematics course.
  Because the S-strand presumes the M- strand and the M-strand presumes the
  G-strand, students will have the most flexibility in their major choice by
  aiming for the S-strand. A student who chooses to meet the general education<font color="#CC0000">
  </font>mathematics requirement with the G-strand will have the most restricted set of
  major choices.</p>

  <h4><a name="COMP">Composition Requirement</a></h4>
  <p><font color="#9C0800">(Policy updated 12/05/03: Added options for transfer students)</font></p>
  <p>A minimum of six units of English composition is required. Placement in
  composition courses is based on scores resulting from the UA First-Year
  Composition Placement Exam, and the English section of the ACT or the Test of
  Standard Written English portion of the SAT.</p>
  <p>First-year students will enroll in one of four strands, varying with
  placement:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A two-course sequence of English 101 and English 102, or English 107 and<br>
      English 108 (the ESL equivalents)</li>
    <li>A two-course sequence of extended English 101 and<br>
      English 102, or extended English 107 and English 108</li>
    <li>A two-course honors sequence of English 103h and<br>
      English 104h</li>
    <li>English 109, in combination with an AP score of 4 or 5,<br>
      or a placement writing portfolio demonstrating<br>
      advanced proficiency.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Transfer students who are admitted with 56 transferable units or who have
  earned a previous bachelor's degree from another institution may satisfy the
  English Composition requirement by submitting to the Writing Program
  coordinator, Modern Languages Building, Room 380, one of the following for
  consideration:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A catalog course description or syllabus for 2 transferable
      composition/writing courses that do not fulfill another UA degree
      requirement.
    <li>A portfolio of 3 - 4 writing samples (an adequate sample consists of 15
      - 20 pages illustrating an analytical, argumentative, or critical response
      to a text) from courses completed at the transfer institution.
    <li>A catalog course description for 1 transferable composition/writing
      course that is not used to satisfy another degree requirement, in addition
      to a portfolio of writing samples (see above).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Upon approval by the Writing Program coordinator of 2 transferable
  composition/writing courses or portfolio of writing samples, the first-year
  English Composition requirement will be satisfied.&nbsp; All questions about first-year composition should be directed

  <h3><a name="TIER">Tier One and Tier Two</a></h3>
  <p>Both Tier One and Tier Two courses offer rigorous treatments of fundamental
  knowledge and methods of inquiry. They are designed to foster independent,
  creative, and interactive learning, inspiring students to think about
  themselves, others, and social organizations in new and insightful ways.
  Students are exposed to various areas of study and acquire valuable skills and
  knowledge applicable to their lives at the University and beyond.</p>
  <h4>Tier One</h4>
  <p>Tier One courses introduce new students to fundamental issues and concepts
  pertinent to three study areas: Traditions and Cultures, Individuals and
  Societies, and Natural Sciences. Students are required to take two courses in
  each segment of Tier One, for a total of six courses. Students entering the
  University as freshmen will be expected to complete Tier One requirements by
  the end of the midpoint of their degree (e.g. for a four-year 120-unit degree
  program by the end of the second year of full-time work or the completion of
  60 units).</p>
