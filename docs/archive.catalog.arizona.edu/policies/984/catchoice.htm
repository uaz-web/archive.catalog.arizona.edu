<h2>Choice of Catalog </h2>

<p>The catalog is the University's primary official source of departmental, college and
university-wide information related to academic programs. Courses, programs and policies
that govern progress towards completion of an undergraduate degree are described in the
catalog. Students maintaining <a href="contenrl.htm">continuous enrollment</a> follow the
requirements outlined by the catalog in effect when they first enroll in a public Arizona
community college or university. A student may choose instead to follow the requirements
outlined by any single catalog in effect during subsequent terms of continuous enrollment.
Each student is responsible for knowing and abiding by the policies described in the
catalog chosen.</p>

<p>Students admitted or readmitted to a public Arizona community college or university
during a summer term follow the requirements of the catalog in effect the following fall
semester. Students transferring among Arizona public higher education institutions must
meet the admission requirements, residency requirements, and all curricular and academic
requirements of the degree-granting institution. </p>
