  <a href="../../2005-06/policies/gpa.htm"> grade-point-average (GPA)</a>. If the qualifications are met, the student may have a maximum of four
  consecutive semesters of course work disregarded in all calculations regarding
  academic standing, grade-point-average, and eligibility for graduation. If
  summer work is to be included in the work to be disregarded, a five-week summer term

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">At the time the request is filed, a minimum of five years shall have
      elapsed since the most recent course work to be disregarded was completed.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">In the interval between the completion of the most recent course work to
      be disregarded and the filing of the request, the student shall have
      completed a minimum of 30 units of regularly graded course work at the
      University with a minimum grade-point-average of 2.500 on all work
      completed at the University in that interval.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">If more than one semester or term is to be disregarded, these shall be 
	consecutive, completed within any 24-month period, and with no intervening 
	enrollments at the University. The maximum of 24 months may be extended by 
	one semester, if the time period includes a semester of involuntary absence 
	by reason of disqualification.</font></li>

	semester or term in which necessary courses are disregarded, including those 
	used in a certified Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC), should be 
	aware that they are responsible for satisfying the degree requirements 
	fulfilled by those courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To complete their degree requirements, 
	students have the following options:</span></font></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">Repeat the same

	foreign language and/or a specific science, establish proficiency with the 
	completion of a higher level course;</span></li>

	coordinator for review and possible completion of this requirement.</span></li>
</ul>
  <p><font face="Arial">If the student satisfies the conditions 
for 
Academic Renewal under this policy, the Office of the Registrar will annotate the student’s permanent academic record to
  indicate that no work taken during the disregarded semester(s) or term(s),
  even if satisfactory, may apply toward graduation. However, all work will
  remain on the record, ensuring a true and accurate academic history.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Academic Renewal may be effected only once during a student’s
  undergraduate academic career and is not available to students who have
  completed requirements for a bachelor’s degree.</font></p>
