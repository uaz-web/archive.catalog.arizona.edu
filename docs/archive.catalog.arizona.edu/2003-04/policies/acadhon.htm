<h2 align="center">Academic Policies</h2>
<h4 align="center">Academic Honors and Awards</h4>
<p align="left"><b>University Academic Honors</b></p>
  <p>Honors are bestowed as recognition of outstanding academic achievement and
  as a means to further encourage sound scholarship.&nbsp; They are awarded to every
  undergraduate student attaining the required proficiency.&nbsp; For some awards,
  students also receive certificates. The University of Arizona
  supports academic achievement and is pleased to recognize and reward
  undergraduate students whose performance merits special attention.&nbsp; For more
  information see the <a href="../dept/hnrs.shtml">Honors College</a>
  section.</p>
<p><b>Dean's List<br>
</b><font color="#BA0113">(Policy updated June 26, 2003: clarification on how
students are recognized by their primary
college.)</font></p>
  <p>Three categories of Dean's List are awarded every semester based on units completed for
  credit and letter <a href="grade.htm"> grade</a> (excluding all Pass/Fail [P/F] and Superior/Pass [S/P] grades).&nbsp;
  Also, all Incomplete (I)
  grades must be made up before the honor is bestowed.&nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Dean's List with Distinction -- is based on 15 units and a 4.000
      grade-point-average.</li>
    <li>Dean's List -- is based on 15 units and a grade-point average of
      3.500-3.999.</li>
    <li>Honorable Mention -- is based on 12 units of 3.500 and above
      grade-point-average.</li>
  </ol>
<p>Students awarded these academic honors are recognized by their primary <a href="../dept/aaindex.html">college</a>
  (i.e. the college of their first major or
their first degree program), either at the Honors Convocation the following fall
or through other means determined by the college.&nbsp; This recognition becomes part of the official
  record and appears on the transcript.</p>
<p><b>Academic Distinction&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>Two categories of Distinction are awarded annually based on units completed for credit and
  letter <a href="grade.htm"> grade</a> (excluding all Pass/Fail [P/F] and Superior/Pass [S/P] grades).&nbsp;
Also, all Incomplete (I) grades must be made up before the honor is bestowed.&nbsp;
Distinction is based on all University credit completed in the prior year,
beginning with Summer Pre-session and inclusive of
Summer Sessions I and II, Fall, Winter, and
Spring terms, and non-term Web-based credit, but excluding correspondence
credit.&nbsp; During each regular semester (i.e. Fall and Spring), students must
complete a minimum of 12 graded units.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Highest Academic Distinction -- is based on 30 units and a 4.000
      grade-point-average.</li>
    <li>Academic Distinction -- is based on 30 units and a grade-point-average of 3.500-3.999.</li>
  </ol>
<p>Students awarded these academic honors are recognized at the Honors
  Convocation of their primary <a href="../dept/aaindex.html"> college</a> (i.e. the college of their first major or
their first degree program) the following Fall.&nbsp; Students awarded either
category of Distinction will receive a certificate from their primary college.</p>
<p><b>Graduation with Academic Distinction<br>
</b><font color="#BA0113">(Policy updated August 25, 2003: reference to
graduates with the Juris Doctor Degree deleted per request of the College of
Law.)</font></p>
  <p>Three categories are awarded for superior scholarship in work leading to
  the bachelor's degree.&nbsp; This honor, based upon graduation grade-point-average,
  becomes part of the official record, is awarded upon graduation and appears on
  the <img alt="External Link" src="../images/globe-external.gif" border="0" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://registrar.arizona.edu/transcripts?audience=students"http://www.registrar.arizona.edu"cat1=22"http://www.registrar.arizona.edu/transcripts/default.htm"cat2=192">transcript</a> and diploma of the recipient.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Summa Cum Laude -- is awarded to candidates whose
      grade-point-average is 3.900 or higher.</li>
    <li>Magna Cum Laude -- is awarded to candidates whose grade-point-average is 3.700-3.899.</li>
    <li>Cum Laude -- is awarded to candidates whose grade-point-average

  </ol>
<p>To be eligible for distinction at graduation, bachelor's degree candidates
  must have completed at least 45 graded units with letter grades that carry the
  required grade-point-average.&nbsp; Also, in computing the above
grade-point-averages, only <font color="#FF0000"> <a href="definiti.htm#ucredit">University
Credit</a></font> is considered.&nbsp;
  This policy applies to all
  students graduating in December 1998 or later.</p>
  <p><b>Graduation with Honors</b></p>
  <p>Graduation with Honors is bestowed on students who have completed all 
	requirements of the University-wide Honors Program. This academic 
	recognition becomes part of the official record and is noted on the 
	transcript and diploma of the recipient. Honors students also wear a special 
	cord and medallion at graduation.</p>
  <p><b>Other Awards and Honors</b></p>
  <p>Other awards and honors in recognition of outstanding academic achievement
  are bestowed through the various colleges and departments.&nbsp; Also, colleges and
  departments offer participation in discipline-based honor societies and
  associations.&nbsp; Interested students should contact departmental and college
  academic advisors.</p>
