  programs in Spain, and in Portuguese in a semester program in Fortaleza,
  Brazil.</p>
  <p>The department offers programs leading to the following

  either language and culture or in Hispanic language and linguistics; or the
  Bachelor of Arts with a major in Portuguese, with a specialization in language
  and literature; the Bachelor of Arts in Education with a teaching major in
  Spanish; Master of Arts with a major in Spanish, and an emphasis in either
  literature or language and linguistics; the Master of Arts in with a major in
  teaching and teacher education in the College of Education; and the Doctor of Philosophy with a major in
  Spanish.</p>
  <p>The Spanish for Native Speakers (SNS) Program consists of a
  series of courses designed for the student who learned Spanish from early
  childhood at home or with relatives (as opposed to as a second language or
  foreign language in school). The SNS program emphasizes writing, grammar,
  speaking skills and cultural awareness.</p>
