<h4 align="center">Academic Renewal for Undergraduate Students</h4>
<p>Under certain circumstances, an undergraduate student may apply to the<img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">Office of the Registrar</a> for 
<a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">
Academic Renewal</a>. Academic Renewal allows students
  to have <a href="grade.htm"> grades</a> for a particular period of time excluded from the
  <a href="gpa.htm"> grade-point-average (GPA)</a>. If the qualifications are 
met, the student may have a maximum of four consecutive semesters of course work 
disregarded in all calculations regarding academic standing, 
grade-point-average, and eligibility for graduation. If summer work is to be 
included in the work to be disregarded, a five-week summer session
  shall count as one-half semester.</p>
  <p>A student must meet with an <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://advising.arizona.edu/content/academic-advisor-directory">academic advisor</a> in his/her college dean�s
  office prior to submitting the application to the Office of the Registrar.</p>
  <p>To qualify for 
Academic Renewal, the following conditions must be met:</p>
<ul>
    <li>At the time the request is filed, a minimum of five years shall have
      elapsed since the most recent course work to be disregarded was completed.</li>
    <li>In the interval between the completion of the most recent course work to
      be disregarded and the filing of the request, the student shall have
      completed a minimum of 30 units of regularly graded course work at the
      University with a minimum grade-point-average of 2.500 on all work
      completed at the University in that interval.</li>
    <li>If more than one semester or term is to be disregarded, these shall be 
	consecutive, completed within any 24-month period, and with no intervening 
	enrollments at the University. The maximum of 24 months may be extended by 
	one semester, if the time period includes a semester of involuntary absence 
	by reason of disqualification.</li>
</ul>

	<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Students considering </span>Academic Renewal<span style="font-size: 11.0pt"> for a 
	semester or term in which necessary courses are disregarded, including those 
	used in a certified Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC), should be 
	aware that they are responsible for satisfying the degree requirements 
	fulfilled by those courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To complete their degree requirements, 
	students have the following options:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">Repeat the same 
	courses to fulfill the requirements;</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">Select different 
	courses, with the college advisor�s approval, that do not apply toward 
	another degree requirement;</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">For mathematics, 
	foreign language and/or a specific science, establish proficiency with the 
	completion of a higher level course;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">For freshman 
	composition, submit a portfolio of writing samples to the Writing Program 
	coordinator for review and possible completion of this requirement.</span></li>
</ul>
  <p>If the student satisfies the conditions 
for 
Academic Renewal under this policy, the Office of the Registrar will annotate the student�s permanent academic record to
  indicate that no work taken during the disregarded semester(s) or term(s),
  even if satisfactory, may apply toward graduation. However, all work will
  remain on the record, ensuring a true and accurate academic history.</p>
  <p>Academic Renewal may be effected only once during a student�s
  undergraduate academic career and is not available to students who have
  completed requirements for a bachelor�s degree.<br>
