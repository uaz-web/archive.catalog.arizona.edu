<p class="MsoBodyText">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">
<font size="2">Candidates for a second bachelor's degree at The University of Arizona must earn 
no fewer than 30 units in addition to the units required for the first degree, 
and must meet all requirements for the second degree. The additional units may 
be completed concurrently with those applying to the first degree; however, at 
least 30 unique units of University Credit (units in residence not used for the first 
degree) must be 
completed for the second degree.&nbsp; 
If the degrees are completed concurrently, the 30 units are added to the degree 
with the higher unit requirement.&nbsp; </font> </span>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal"><font size="2">For 
sequential degrees, students must complete at least 50 percent of all course 
work required in the major of the second degree after the conferral of the first 
degree.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Students 
may apply for a simultaneous or sequential second degree only if the degree 
title and major differ from the first.&nbsp; Students pursuing another academic 
program that would lead to the same degree title as the primary program must 
declare that program as an additional major, not a second degree.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two or more 
majors may be completed within one academic degree program as long as these 
majors lead to the same degree title.&nbsp; However, after the first degree is 
awarded, another major cannot be appended to it.&nbsp; Students may instead pursue a 
post-baccalaureate certificate, a graduate degree, or a second baccalaureate 
with a degree title and major that differ from the first.&nbsp; </font> </span></p>
