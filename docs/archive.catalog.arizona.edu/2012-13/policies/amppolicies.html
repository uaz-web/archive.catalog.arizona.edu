<p align="center"><strong>Degree and Tuition Policies</strong></p>
<p class="style3">Students will be considered undergraduates until they complete 
their undergraduate requirements, which should be no later than the end of the 
fourth year. Students entering with Advanced Placement Credit or who attend 
summer school would likely graduate with their Bachelor�s in the 3rd year. 
Students must take at least 12 of their graduate credits while in graduate 
status. In other words,</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">During years 1-3 (or approximately 0-90 credits) students 
	will be taking undergraduate coursework and charged at the undergraduate 
	rate. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Once admitted to AMP, during the senior (or transition 
	year), they may take up to 12 units of graduate coursework which may apply 
	toward both the Bachelor�s and the Master�s degrees. Students will be 
	charged at the undergraduate rate and retain eligibility for undergraduate 
	scholarships. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Students classified as seniors who have not yet completed 
	a bachelor's degree may enroll in 500-level courses following the
	<a href="grad_credit_seniors.htm">Gradute Credit for Seniors Policy</a>. 
	Courses numbered at the 600, 700 and 900 levels are not open to 
	undergraduates. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">After completion of all Bachelors� requirements, students 
	will be granted graduate status, be charged at the graduate rate, and be 
	eligible for graduate assistantships. The student won�t be eligible to 
	graduate nor will they be eligible for assistantships until all Bachelors� 
	requirements are completed. While an undergraduate, students are required to 
	keep their graduate coursework cumulative GPA at 3.0 or higher to be 
	admitted to the M.S. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Should a student have completed 12 graduate credits, but 
	not yet completed the undergraduate degree, they will be considered graduate 
	for financial aid and tuition purposes and coded as �graduate� in SIS. They 
	will no longer be eligible for undergraduate scholarships. Nor will they be 
	eligible for graduate assistantships. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">At least 12 graduate credits must be taken while in 
	graduate status, after completing all degree requirements for the 
	Bachelor�s. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Students should be encouraged to complete their 
	undergraduate requirements as soon as possible, but not later than one 
	semester before receiving their master�s. Students finishing their 
	undergraduate requirements later than one semester before receiving their 
	master�s they will no longer be eligible for undergraduate scholarships. Nor 
	will they be eligible for graduate assistantships. Neither degree will be 
	awarded until the undergraduate requirements are completed along with the 
	Master�s requirements. </p>
