<h1><img src="images/images1997/official-scroll.gif" align="right" hspace="0" WIDTH="109" HEIGHT="87"><small>How to use the UA General Catalog</small></h1>

<p>Welcome to <em>Desert Lynx, </em>The University of Arizona's electronic catalog. <em>Desert
Lynx</em> contains information about University policies, courses, and academic programs
that currently govern progress towards an undergraduate degree. You are responsible for
knowing and understanding the contents of your <a href="policies/974/catchoice.htm">chosen
catalog</a>. To help you make better use of the electronic catalog, we've explained some
of its elements below.</p>

<h2>Two ways to use the catalog</h2>

<p>Catalog information is available in two formats. General catalog information is
available from the catalog's home page. Anyone can use this page to learn more about UA
majors and degree programs, courses of instruction, academic policies, graduation
requirements, and anything else that bears directly on completing a baccalaureate degree
at the University. The links that appear on the home page are explained briefly below.</p>

<p>Personalized information is available to enrolled UA students who are governed by the
1997-1998 and subsequent catalogs. You may access this information by clicking on the
button labeled &quot;Personalized Catalog&quot;, found on the button bar at the left edge
of the home page. That button will take you to <em>Student Link</em>, a group of services
that gives students access to their own computerized records. Once you enter your student
ID and PIN number, <em>Student Link</em> will take you directly to your personalized
catalog. The personalized catalog is also available through <em>Student Link</em>. Once
you are at the <em>Student Link</em> home page, you will find a list of options that
include a Catalog option (look for it at the left edge of the screen). Click on <img src="images/images1998/s-link.gif" align="absbottom" WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="37"> and you'll see catalog
information specific to your declared major. </p>

<p>The personalized catalog screen will show your college and major, along with
information about your major department, degree requirements, faculty, major courses, and
academic policies. Also available are links to the general catalog, the <em>Schedule of
Classes</em>, and lists of faculty and all courses of instruction.</p>

<p>UA students who follow requirements outlined in catalogs earlier than 1997-1998 will
find that some information about them is not available electronically. For example,
academic policies for years earlier than 1997-1998 are not available on line. Students
governed by earlier catalogs should speak with an advisor or consult the appropriate
catalog for such information.</p>

<h2>Organization of the catalog</h2>

<p>The electronic catalog provides information about academic policies, courses of
instruction, and undergraduate degree programs and graduation requirements. The home page
includes a table of contents, providing links to all major subcategories of catalog

<h2>Official and Unofficial Seals</h2>

<p><img src="images/images1997/official-scroll.gif" width="73" height="58"> <img src="images/images1997/official-lg.gif" width="40" height="42"> <img src="images/images1997/official-sm.gif" width="20" height="21">
The three versions of the big A seal signify that the associated information is official
University policy. One of the seals is found at or near the top of all catalog pages. </p>

<p><img src="images/images1997/unofficial-lg.gif" width="40" height="42"> <img src="images/images1997/unofficial-sm.gif" width="20" height="21"> The unofficial icon (an official seal that's been cancelled)
indicates that the associated information is not official catalog information. The
unofficial icon is used primarily to identify links to non-catalog pages, such as
department or college home pages. </p>
