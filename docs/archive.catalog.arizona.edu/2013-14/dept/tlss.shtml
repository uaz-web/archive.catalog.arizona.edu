    <p>The Department of Teaching, Learning and Sociocultural Studies is in the <a href="ed.shtml">College
    of Education</a>.</p>
  <p>The department is committed to scholarship and leadership in the
  development of a knowledge base consisting of theory, research and practice
  related to language and reading in the context of culture. The department's
  research, teaching and service addresses bilingualism, biliteracy,
  bilingual/multicultural education, language acquisition and variation,
  literacy development and the relationships of language, culture, teaching and
  learning.</p> 
  <p>The department offers programs directed toward the certification of elementary and secondary
   school teachers, the continuing education of certified members of the teaching profession, and
    advanced graduate preparation of professional educators.</p>
		<p><b>Programs</b></p>
		<p>At the undergraduate level, the department offers programs leading to the Bachelor of Arts in Education 
		with a major in elementary education or early childhood education. Students interested in teaching at the secondary
		 school level should select a major offered by a college other than Education and earn the degree appropriate to the
		  chosen major (for example: Bachelor of Arts  - History). Prospective students should consult the Office of Student
		   Services within the College of Education for more information, (520) 621-7865.  Endorsements in middle level teaching 
		   and bilingual education are also available for either elementary or secondary programs.</p>
		<p>The College of Education also offers a post-baccalaureate teacher preparation program at both the elementary and secondary levels.  
		Individuals interested in teaching at the secondary level are encouraged to consult advisors in the academic department of their proposed 
		major for information about appropriate course work in that discipline. 
		For information about the professional elementary and secondary education course requirements, consult the Office of Student Services 
		within the College of Education.</p>
		<p><b>Master of Education M.Ed</b></p>
		<p>A fast-track, one-year master's degree leading to an elementary or secondary teaching certificate is also offered in the Department of 
		Teaching, Learning and Sociocultural Studies.  This program is designed in collaboration with eight Tucson-area school districts and 
		offers an intensive field-based teacher preparation experience. Contact the Teaching and Teacher Education unit in the College of Education, Room 
		702 or phone (520) 621-6993, for more information about this program.</p>
