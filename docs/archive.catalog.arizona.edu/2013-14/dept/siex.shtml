<p>The Department of Systems and
    Industrial Engineering is in the <a href="en.shtml">College of
    Engineering</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering (ABET Accredited)</b></p>
  <p>Industrial engineering focuses on the design and implementation of
  integrated systems of people, materials, machines, energy and information.
  After first specifying system objectives, industrial engineers combine
  technical knowledge and skill from the physical, engineering and social
  sciences to design, implement, and operate the system. The industrial engineer
  is charged with the responsibility of ensuring high quality while
  simultaneously meeting cost and output goals. This is accomplished through the
  optimal allocation of resources throughout the system.<br>
  <br>
  Industrial engineers practice in both administrative and production segments
  of manufacturing and service organizations. Industrial engineers are commonly
  employed in heavy industry (such as steel), medium industry (such as plastics
  and computers), and light industry (such as electronics assembly), health-care
  delivery, telecommunications, transportation and government. In each of these
  environments, industrial engineers are involved with a variety of systems such
  as production planning, quality assurance, inventory control, management
  information, facility layout, job/workplace design, material flow, and
  distribution. The importance of manufacturing is reflected by the presence of
  a manufacturing system engineering option.<br>
  <br>
  The modern manufacturing systems engineer designs, installs, implements,
  improves and manages information-driven integrated manufacturing systems. This
  option prepares students to organize, schedule, and manage the total
  manufacturing system, from product design through fabrication, distribution
  and consumer services.</p>
  <p><b>Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering (ABET Accredited)</b></p>
  <p>Systems engineers design and build systems to meet the needs of people. As
  computing speed and analytic sophistication have increased, society's needs
  have become more varied and complex. Graduates of the systems engineering
  program are prepared to face these needs.<br>
  <br>
  The goal of a systems engineer is to make the best use of resources. Stated
  formally, systems engineering is concerned with the processes and methodology
  of modeling, analyzing and designing technologically advanced systems that
  function safely, effectively, and economically. It requires appreciation and
  understanding of machines, people, software, hardware, materials, and energy.
  Systems engineers work on a wide range of activities and applications,
  including communication systems, computer networking, manufacturing systems,
  robotics, transportation systems, health-care systems, societal problems and
  all phases of both industrial and military research and design. To prepare
  students for careers of such exceptional diversity, the systems engineering
  curriculum includes operations research, probability and statistics, numerical
  computing methods, artificial intelligence courses, robotics, and human
  factors. This is clearly a broader program than most traditional engineering
  disciplines.</p>
  <p>Since computing and related methodology are invariably an integral part of
  modern systems engineering, the department offers a software option within the
  systems engineering curriculum.
