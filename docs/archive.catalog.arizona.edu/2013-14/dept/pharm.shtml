  <p>The College of Pharmacy prepares pharmacists to provide pharmaceutical and
  related health care services. These services are mainly concerned with
  optimizing the therapeutic effects and minimizing the adverse effects of
  drugs. The professional program in the College of Pharmacy is fully accredited
  by the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education.</p>
  <p><b>Professional Degree Program</b></p>
  <p>The professional degree offered by the College of Pharmacy is the Doctor of
  Pharmacy (Pharm.D.).&nbsp; Consult the Pharm.D. Major/Degree Requirements (APRR) for
  both pre-pharmacy and professional requirements.&nbsp; The program for this
  degree is based upon a minimum of six years of college work (two years of
  pre-pharmacy and four years in the College of Pharmacy).&nbsp; Admission to
  the Doctor of Pharmacy program requires completion of the pre-pharmacy
  curriculum.&nbsp; Additional information about the pre-pharmacy curriculum,
  all professional requirements, approved general electives and clerkships is
  also available from the Office of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs,
  College of Pharmacy.</p>
  <p><b>Graduate Programs</b></p>
  <p>In addition to the Pharmaceutical Sciences programs, College of Pharmacy
  faculty also contribute heavily to the Pharmacology and Toxicology Graduate
  program.</p>
