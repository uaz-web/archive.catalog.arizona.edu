A Global Perspective on Schooling </b>(3) I This exploratory course will introduce
students to the role of schools in society through a comprehensive review of culture and
traditions. Emphasis will be placed on social issues and trends that impact schooling and

educational system?; how has the role of the teacher changed?; how does American education
&quot;stack up&quot; against other countries? and are current reforms really going to
improve education? are among the topical questions addressed in this course. Students will
be expected to participate in field study and observation experiences in school settings.
