<p><b><a name="AFAS224" >AFAS
224</a> Models of Resistance, Post 16th Cent. African Liberation Movements in
Southeast </b>(3) I There were actually several &quot;Souths&quot; during the
Holocaust of Enslavement. However, courses taught in the era of African
enslavement have tended to focus on the northern most regions, such as Virginia,
which are often taken to represent-if not constitute-the South. This course
looks at the other &quot;South&quot; and the French and Spanish colonizers of
South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. It offers a different perspective of the
beginnings of the Great Enslavement and compares and contrasts the lives and
struggles of enslaved, freed, and self-emancipated Africans in the Southwest
during the tenure of Spain. P, two courses from Tier One, Traditions and
Cultures (TRAD 101,102,103,104). (Identical with HIST 224). Approved as Tier Two

<p><b><a name="AFAS304A" >AFAS
304A</a> The Social Construction of Race Whiteness</b> (3) II In constructing
this course, the recognition of whiteness/blackness is not solely a reactionary
response to challenges from persons/non-persons of color; it is also a
reflection of the need to provide a narrative of whiteness/blackness that
intends an understanding of the notion of whiteness/blackness as a racial
category and the implications of this categorization and association. For
example, naming whiteness displaces it from the unmarked, unnamed status that is
itself an effect of dominance. Within the particular, disciplines of
anthropology and ethnic studies, whiteness, blackness and race have come to be
earnest subjects of study. Being white or black in the 1990's, however, is far
from straightforward. It is riddled with ambiguity and marked by a general sense
of racial angst as to what it means to be white or black. This course will
attempt to respond to the question what does it mean to be black/white in our
global climate? This is a temporary course offered Spring 2000 only. P, AFAS
304A is not prerequisite to AFAS 304B.</p>
