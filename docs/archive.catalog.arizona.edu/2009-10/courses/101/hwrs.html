 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; Natural resource managers and policymakers are increasingly encountering the mandate for maintenance of ecosystem function in watersheds. What does this mean? How do we measure ecosystem function? How do we measure positive or negative changes in ecosystems? This course will examine the structure and function of watershed ecosystems with emphasis on the ecosystem and geomorphic processes shaping watersheds. Students are introduced to the processes that shape the structure and functioning of ecosystems and watersheds, their responses to natural and anthropogenic change and recovery to these disturbances. Student will compare different ecosystems to watershed responses to anthropogenic changes and collect data from selected field sites to explore the relationship among ecosystem processes and changing climate (or other disturbances).  Students will develop the writing skills necessary to communicate technical information, the ability to integrate and contextualize the principles of natural resource management by class field work, and gain an understanding of the importance of proper ecologic functioning to the maintenance of healthy watershed systems.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Prerequisite(s):</b>&nbsp; ECOL 182R.

 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; Natural resource managers and policymakers are increasingly encountering the mandate for maintenance of ecosystem function in watersheds. What does this mean? How do we measure ecosystem function? How do we measure positive or negative changes in ecosystems? This course will examine the structure and function of watershed ecosystems with emphasis on the ecosystem and geomorphic processes shaping watersheds. Students are introduced to the processes that shape the structure and functioning of ecosystems and watersheds, their responses to natural and anthropogenic change and recovery to these disturbances. Student will compare different ecosystems to watershed responses to anthropogenic changes and collect data from selected field sites to explore the relationship among ecosystem processes and changing climate (or other disturbances).  Students will develop the writing skills necessary to communicate technical information, the ability to integrate and contextualize the principles of natural resource management by class field work, and gain an understanding of the importance of proper ecologic functioning to the maintenance of healthy watershed systems. Graduate-level requirements include conducting a literature review of an ecosystem and its response to anthropogenic change or disturbance and work as a group to synthesize these data across ecosystems.
