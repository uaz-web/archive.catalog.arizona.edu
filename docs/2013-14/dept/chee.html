<p>The Department of Chemical and
    Environmental Engineering is in the <a href="en.html">College of
    Engineering</a>.</p>
  <p>Chemical engineers apply basic principles of chemistry, physics and
  mathematics to the development of safe, environmentally and economically sound
  processes in which chemical and/or physical changes take place. Environmental
  engineers apply those same basic principles directly to the prevention and
  remediation of environmental problems. These curricula prepare students for
  employment in research, development, design and operations aspects of the
  chemical, energy, environmental, food, micro-electronics, petroleum,
  pharmaceutical, plastics and related industries.</p>
  <p>The department participates in the Honors Program.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering (ABET Accredited)</b></p>
  <p>Chemical engineering is a profession which provides society with materials
  and energy in a safe and environmentally sound way. The discipline focuses on
  how chemicals are brought together to react, and how chemical products are
  separated, purified, mixed, heated, contained, transported, and remediated.
  Computer tools are used throughout the chemical and related industries as an
  integral part of making processes viable and economical. A Bachelor's degree
  in Chemical Engineering prepares students for many professional schools
  including medical school, law school, and business school in addition to
  graduate school in chemical engineering, biomedical engineering,
  bioengineering, and material science and engineering.</p>
