<p><b><font size="3">University Credit</font></b></p>
  <p>University credit is the term used to identify all credit offered by the
  University of Arizona with the exception of correspondence credit and <a href="profexam.htm#Special Exam">Special
  Examination for Credit</a>. Only the <a href="grade.htm"> grades</a> of courses taken for University
  credit and by <a href="profexam.htm#Special Exam">Special Examination for
  Grade</a> are used in calculating the <a href="gpa.htm"> grade-point-average
  (GPA)</a>.</p>
  <p><b><font size="3">Unit of Credit</font></a>, Definition</font></b></p>
  <p>Utilizing the definition that an hour of work is the equivalent of 50
  minutes of class time (often called a contact hour) or 60 minutes of
  independent-study work, university policy requires at least 45 hours of work
  by each student for each unit of credit. Contact hours required for specific
  types of courses are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>At least 15 contact hours of recitation, lecture, discussion, seminar,
      or colloquium, as well as a minimum of 30 hours of student homework are
      required for each unit of student credit.</li>
    <li>Workshops require at least 15 through 45 contact hours and the
      appropriate number of homework hours to comprise a total of at least 45
      hours of work for each unit of credit.</li>
    <li>Studios require at least 30 contact hours and at least 15 hours of
      homework for each unit of credit.</li>
    <li>Laboratory courses must maintain a minimum of 45 contact hours per unit
      of credit.</li>
    <li>Field trips are to be counted hour-for-hour as laboratory meetings.</li>
    <li>Each unit of internship or practicum must require a minimum of 45 hours
      of work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Since it would be virtually impossible for a student to complete
  satisfactorily 45 hours of work in less than one week, the policy regarding
  the duration of courses maintains that a course must cover at least a one-week
  period for every unit of credit given. During the summer session, however, 6
  units of credit might be given over a five-week period.</p>
  <p>It is understood that, when the official university calendar deviates from
  these guidelines, that calendar shall prevail.</p>
  <p>It is also understood that the hour requirements specified above represent
  minimums for average students and that considerable deviation in excess of
  these requirements may occur, particularly at the graduate level.</p>
