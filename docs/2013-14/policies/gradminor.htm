<p>A minor subject is not required for a Master'sDegree, but at least one supporting minor of nine or more units is required for the PhD.  
If a doctoral student chooses two supporting minor subjects, each minor must have at least six units of coursework. Although the minor subjects 
are usually taken outside the major department, minors within the major department may be permitted with the approval of the student'smajor 
professor.  </p>
<p>The selection of a minor must be approved by the student'smajor professor and must be included in the<img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">

to be filed with the Graduate College no later than the student's third semester in residence. With respect to the minor subject, the 
Plan of Study identifies: (1) courses the student intends to transfer from other institutions; (2) courses already completed at The 
University of Arizona which the student intends to apply toward the minor; and (3) additional course work that will complete the minor.  </p>

in depth within the areas of specialization.  Should the student change a minor subject following the comprehensive examination, 
the student must take a new comprehensive exam covering the new minor.</p>
