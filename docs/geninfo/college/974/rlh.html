<h3><a name="adm">Admission </a></h3>

<p>Admission to the College of Law is very competitive. The College seeks to enroll a
class of approximately 150 students reflecting diverse talents and experiences each fall.
For the Fall 1994 entering class, 2,444 candidates applied for admission, 399 candidates
were admitted and 151 students enrolled. The median LSAT for the 1994 first-year class was
a 162 (approximately the 89th percentile) and the median undergraduate grade-point average
was 3.34. Applicants for admission to the College of Law must have earned a bachelor's
degree from an accredited college or university. The College of Law does not favor
particular undergraduate majors or institutions. Instead, applicants are urged to pursue a
rigorous educational experience in a diverse, balanced curriculum, to read extensively and
to develop strong analytical and writing skills. Admission is based on the applicant's
prior academic achievement, aptitude for the study of law as indicated by the score on the
Law School Admission Test (LSAT), personal statement and references. </p>

<h3>Admission Process </h3>

<p>Applicants are initially evaluated according to personal statements, references and a
formula that combines the candidate's undergraduate grade-point average and score on the
LSAT. Many admittees are selected from the pool of applicants based primarily upon the
quality of their undergraduate academic performance and LSAT scores. </p>

<p>The balance of the entering class will be chosen by the evaluation of the Admissions
Committee from a group of exceptional candidates whose backgrounds and academic records
demonstrate achievement, and who promise to make a significant contribution to the legal
educational process, the legal profession and the community. We believe that diverse
experiences, ideas and goals are essential to a vital educational process and a dynamic
legal profession. In addition to academic records and test scores, the Committee looks to
other factors in the assessment of applicants, including colleges or universities
attended, course of study, grade trends, graduate study, significant or extracurricular
activities, unique educational or occupational experiences, involvement in community
affairs, substantial community service, race and ethnicity, economic or cultural
background, participation in pre-law school programs (e.g., CLEO) and any other factors
that may justifiably be relied upon in appraising the qualifications of applicants for
success in law school and contribution to the legal profession. In making the selections,
the Committee considers the individual strengths and characteristics of each applicant and
the entire file submitted by each applicant in the context of the applicant pool for each
year. </p>

<h3>Application Procedure </h3>

<p>First-year students are admitted only for the Fall semester. Under very special
circumstances, offers of admission can be deferred one year at the discretion of the
Assistant Dean for Admissions. Applicants are encouraged to submit their applications
after Oct. 1 of the year prior to anticipated enrollment. </p>

<p><i>All application materials, including the LSDAS report, must be delivered to the
Admissions Office or postmarked no later than March 1 of the year of expected enrollment.</i>
</p>

<p>1. To complete an application file, a candidate for admission must submit: </p>

<p>A. Application for admission. </p>

<p>B. Personal statement (See item 2 below). </p>

<p>C. Self-addressed, stamped postcards. </p>

<p>D. LSDAS report sent to the College directly by Law Services (See item 4 below). </p>

<p>E. Domicile Affidavit. </p>

<p>F. Two letters of recommendation (See item 5 below). </p>

<p>G. A <b>nonrefundable</b> $35 application processing fee. (Only checks or money orders
payable to the University of Arizona College of Law are acceptable.) </p>

<p>2. The College of Law is particularly interested in students who, by virtue of their
background and experience, will bring diverse interests and perspectives to the student
body. The principal vehicle for describing those varied educational, life and work
experiences is through the personal statement, which is required as part of the
application. A candidate's <b>personal statement</b> should be a typed, concise and
well-drafted document of two to three pages. It should demonstrate the candidate's writing
ability and highlight the candidate's unique characteristics and personal qualities,
including educational and work experiences, talents and special interests, cultural and
economic background, in-volvement in community affairs and public service or any events or
circumstances that have helped shape the applicant's life or given it direction. </p>

<p>3. All candidates must take the <b>Law School Admission Test (LSAT)</b>, which is given
at centers in the United States several times a year. Information about the test can be
obtained by writing Law School Admission Services (LSAS), Box 2000, Newtown, PA 18940-0998
or by contacting the nearest law school or prelaw advisor. In order to meet the March 1
deadline for complete applications, candidates must take the test no later than the <b>December</b>
administration of the year prior to anticipated enrollment. Scores for the February test
(of the year of anticipated enrollment) will arrive after the deadline. </p>

<p>An applicant may take the LSAT more than once; however, the scores usually will be
averaged for use in the initial evaluation formula. LSAT scores earned prior to June 1991
will not be accepted for Fall 1995 enrollment and thereafter. If candidates have questions
about whether to re-take the LSAT, contact the Admissions Office. </p>

<p>4. All applicants must register for a <b>Law School Data Assembly Service Report
(LSDAS)</b>. LSDAS reports are produced only for candidates who are registered with and
have paid all fees to LSDAS. All candidates must sign the LSDAS &quot;Authorization to
Release Education Records, Agreement to Conditions, Signature&quot; section. Please refer
to the current <i>LSAT/LSDAS Registration and Information Book.</i> </p>

<p><b>It is important to recognize that considerable lead time is required for the LSDAS
process.<i> To ensure timely completion of applications, we recommend that candidates
register with LSDAS and submit transcripts from each undergraduate institution attended to
LSDAS prior to January 1.</i> Students should provide to LSDAS transcripts of any
coursework completed after the initial submission to LSDAS. It is wise to keep receipts
for transcripts and LSDAS services as evidence of compliance with deadlines.</b> </p>

<p>Graduate transcripts should also be sent to LSDAS. Graduate grades will not be analyzed
on the report but the transcripts will be attached to the back of the report. </p>

<p>5. The College of Law requires that applicants submit <b>two letters of recommendation.</b>
Candidates are encouraged to provide two strong, substantive letters from undergraduate or
graduate faculty under whom they have studied or others qualified to address the
candidate's analytical abilities, writing skills, unique talents and personal qualities.
Candidates are urged to send letters in separate sealed envelopes with their applications,
to facilitate proper filing. Letters sent directly to the College of Law should be sent to
the Assistant Dean for Admissions. </p>

<h3>Applicants Who Have Previously Applied To This Law School </h3>

<p>Applicants who have been admitted or denied in previous years must file a <b>new
application</b>, personal statement, references, domicile affidavit, self-addressed,
stamped status card and a $35 application processing fee. Additionally, all such
applicants must again register with LSDAS and have a new LSDAS report, with the entire
undergraduate record, submitted to The University of Arizona. Previous applicants must
comply with the deadlines stated above. Previous applicants are not required to re-take
the LSAT, provided the LSAT meets the requirements of item 3 above. However, admission to
the College of Law has become increasingly competitive in recent years. Applicants who
have been denied admission and who choose to reapply are urged to consider retaking the
LSAT, rather than relying on a score from an unsuccessful application. </p>

<p>Files containing prior applications, letters of recommendation and personal statements
are retained by the Admissions Office for two years. </p>

<h3>International Students </h3>

<p>International students seeking admission to the College of Law must apply as first-year
students, following the steps outlined in the section on Application Procedure, including
taking the LSAT. There are no exceptions to these requirements. </p>

<p>LSDAS evaluates the transcripts from very few institutions outside the U.S. and Canada.
Applicants who completed undergraduate or graduate work at institutions not evaluated by
LSDAS must provide to the College of Law the following materials to facilitate the
evaluation of their academic records: </p>

<p>1. An official transcript from the undergraduate or graduate institution(s), including
final grades earned. </p>

<p>2. An explanation of the grading system reflected on the transcripts, descriptions of
the courses taken, the nature and format of those courses, the number of class hours
involved and any other pertinent information. </p>

<p>3. A detailed, written transcript analysis by an objective agency unaffiliated with the
applicant. </p>

<p>4. A T.O.E.F.L. score from a test taken during the past year. </p>

<h3>Deadline Summary </h3>

<p><b>First-Year Applicants to J.D. Program</b> </p>

<p>All application materials to the College of Law by <i>March 1</i> of the year of
expected enrollment. </p>

<p>LSAT: Candidates must take the test no later than <i>December</i> of the year prior to
expected enrollment. </p>

<p>LSDAS: Advisory deadline of <i>January 1,</i> to have all transcripts to LSDAS. </p>

<p>Financial Aid Priority Processing Deadline: <i>March 1</i> of the year of expected
enrollment. </p>

<h3>Transfer Applications </h3>

<p>A limited number of second-year students who have done exceptional work at other law
schools may be accepted as transfer students at The University of Arizona in either the
fall or spring of their second year. Transfer applicants will not be accepted at midyear
of the first year or for the third year. However, third-year students may apply as
visiting students. </p>

<p>A transfer applicant must send the following items to the Admissions Office so that
they are received no later than <b>December 1</b>, for applications for the Spring
semester, and no later than <b>July 15</b> for applications for the Fall semester: </p>

<p>1. A completed Application for Transfer Admission. </p>

<p>2. A Domicile Affidavit. </p>

<p>3. An official LSDAS report reflecting the <b>entire undergraduate career</b> and the
LSAT score. </p>

<p>4. An official law school transcript, including grades and class rank received through
the <b>final semester</b> of study. </p>

<p>5. A letter from the dean of the law school the applicant is currently attending
stating that the student is in good standing and eligible to continue studies at that
institution. </p>

<p>6. A <b>nonrefundable</b> $35 application processing fee. (Only checks or money orders,
payable to The University of Arizona College of Law, are acceptable.) </p>

<p>Transfer admission is highly selective. Residents ranked below the top quartile of
their class and nonresidents ranked below the top ten percent of their class usually will
not be accepted as transfer students. <i>Transfer admission is always contingent upon
availability of space.</i> No student who has been disqualified or placed on probation at
another law school or who has failed to maintain at least a &quot;C&quot; average for all
law work attempted will be considered for transfer to the College of Law. </p>

<p>Factors considered in the transfer admission process include: the nature of the law
school attended, the quality of the candidate's performance as a first-year law student,
the nature of the applicant's undergraduate record and LSAT score, the candidate's
admissibility as a first-year applicant, the circumstances surrounding the request to
transfer and letters of recommendation from law faculty with whom the applicant has
studied. </p>

<p>Transfer students will not receive credit for work done at a law school that is not a
member of the Association of American Law Schools or approved by the American Bar
Association. To qualify for graduation, transfer students must do a minimum of three
semesters of academic work, including their final two semesters' work, comprising at least
27 units of credit, in residence at the College of Law. </p>

<h3>Visiting Applications </h3>

<p>A very limited number of third-year students who have done well at other law schools
and have a compelling reason to study at The University of Arizona may be accepted as
visiting students in their third year of law study. It is the policy of the College to
only admit visiting students during their third year of law school. As with transfer
admission, visiting student status is selective and is <i>always</i> contingent upon the
availability of space. A visiting applicant must send the following items to the
Admissions Office so they they are received no later than <b>December 1</b>, for
applications for the Spring semester, and no later than <b>July 15</b>, for applications
for the Fall semester: </p>

<p>1. A completed application for Visiting Admission. </p>

<p>2. A Domicile Affidavit. </p>

<p>3. An official LSDAS report reflecting the <b>entire undergraduate career</b> and the
LSAT score. </p>

<p>4. An official law school transcript including grades and class rank received through
the final semester of study. </p>

<p>5. A letter from the dean of the law school the applicant is currently attending
indicating that the student is in good standing and eligible to continue studies at that
institution. In addition, the letter must also grant permission for the student to enroll
at The University of Arizona College of Law and must state any conditions upon the units
the student's degree-granting law school has agreed to accept. </p>

<p>6. A <b>nonrefundable </b>$35 application processing fee. (Only checks and money
orders, payable to The University of Arizona College of Law, are acceptable.) </p>

<h3><a name="hon">Honor Code </a></h3>

<p>The College of Law has a strict Honor Code that governs student conduct. The College of
Law Honor Code applies to all elements of life at the College, including the admissions
process. Omissions of fact, misrepresentation or false statements may be the basis of
denial or revocation of an offer of admission. </p>

<h3><a name="cha">Character and Fitness </a></h3>

<p>Applicants who intend to practice law should be aware that bar admission in all states
involves consideration of a bar applicant's character and moral fitness for the practice
of law. Applicants should acquaint themselves with the bar admission requirements of the
states in which they intend to practice. </p>

<h3><a name="non">Nondegree Students </a></h3>

<p><i>SPECIAL STUDENTS-</i>A limited number of students without the qualifications
required of candidates for the law degree may, at the discretion of the Dean, the
Associate Dean for Academic Affairs or other designate of the Dean, be allowed to audit a
course or a limited number of courses as Special Students. Applicants must have experience
and educational background that indicate a strong probability that they will be successful
in law study. They must also demonstrate a special need for legal training. The discretion
of the Dean or Associate Dean to permit special students to audit a course is limited to
people within the University community (faculty, staff, graduate students) and members of
the legal profession (lawyers and judges). If permission is granted to anyone within these
designated groups, then the auditing process is administered by the College of Law
Registrar's Office. Students who anticipate the possibility of applying or enrolling as a
full-time student at some point in the future should not seek Special Student status. The
purpose of Special Student status is to meet a specific educational or work-related need,
not to provide a prelaw experience. </p>

<p><i>STUDENTS FROM OTHER COLLEGES-</i>Graduate students participating in a graduate
degree program, with the written approval of their advisors and Dean of the Graduate
College, may register for a limited number of courses in the College of Law. Students
desiring to do so will be required to obtain the approval of the instructor and the
Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the College of Law. </p>

<p>Special students and students from other colleges studying at the College of Law are
not degree candidates, and are not eligible for the bar examination in Arizona. In
addition, law courses taken as a nondegree student cannot be used as credit toward a law
degree should an individual apply, be admitted and enroll subsequently at the College of
Law. </p>

<h3><a name="llm">LL.M. PROGRAM</a> </h3>

<p>The University of Arizona College of Law is now offering a program leading to the
degree of master of laws in international trade law. The LL.M. program, approved by the
American Bar Association and the Arizona Board of Regents, enrolled its first ten students
