professions in the university, community, and commercial sectors. Its programs offer
science-based preparation for researchers, technicians and teachers who will advance
knowledge of human health, prevent disease, and enhance physical performance. The school
also offers courses for graduate and professional study in the health science fields.</p>

<h3><a name="Advanced Standing">Advanced Standing</a></h3>

<p><font size="3">Pre-health majors are admitted to University College. Admission to the
pre-health major does not guarantee admission to advanced standing. Admission to the

upon admission into a specific major. Applicants must have completed a minimum of 56 units
of college credit, applicable to a baccalaureate degree, and must have a GPA of 2.25 or

focusing on the prevention of critical societal health problems. Students may obtain a
major in health education with an option in community health or school health education.
The community health education option provides students with the competencies necessary to
work in governmental, voluntary, clinical, worksite, and commercial health promotion
settings. The school health education option prepares health education teachers for
primary and secondary schools. </p>

<h3>Medical Technology Major</h3>

<p>The Division of Medical Technology provides professional preparation for a career in

following completion of their four-year degree, plan to continue their studies at the
graduate level in such areas as physiology, medicine, dentistry, or another of the wide
range of academic, research, or health care professions. Majors receive basic grounding in
calculus and the biological and physical sciences, and more extensive instruction in the
physiological sciences such as advanced human physiology; cell physiology; endocrine
physiology; exercise physiology; and kinesiology.</p>

<h3>General Education Program </h3>

<p><font size="3">All undergraduate students are required to complete a general education
