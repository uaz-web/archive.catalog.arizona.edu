<h2 align="left"><small>GEOSCIENCES (GEOS)</small></h2>



<p>Geosciences, or those sciences dealing with the study of the Earth, incorporate the

various fields of study that are applicable to an understanding of the formation and

development of chemical, physical and biological aspects of the Earth. Academic and

research pursuits in the geosciences lead toward a professional career in questions

concerning many different Earth processes; in solving or helping to solve the current and

projected issues dealing with land use and urban development; the search for energy

sources, water, industrial and commercial minerals, and in environmental reconstruction at

archaeological sites. The Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, in association with the

department, offers undergraduate and graduate courses in dendrochrolology using tree-rings

to study climatic, ecological, environmental and archaeological problems. </p>



<p>The department offers the following degree programs: Bachelor of Science with

concentrations in geology, geophysics, or environmental geology; and a Master of Science

and Doctor of Philosophy with majors in geosciences. For graduate admissions and degree

requirements, consult the <i>Graduate Catalog</i>. The degree of Bachelor of Science in

Education with a teaching major in earth sciences is available through the College of

Education. </p>



<p>Students also must satisfy university general education requirements, and science

education students must take professional preparation courses in the College of Education.

A variety of geosciences minor options are available to students in other departments:

earth resources, environmental geoscience, geoarchaeology, geochemistry, geophysics,

mineralogy, paleontology, petrology, stratigraphy, and tectonics. A thematic minor also is

an option. An advisor in the student's field of interest will assist in selecting courses.

</p>



<p>The department participates in the honors program.</p>
