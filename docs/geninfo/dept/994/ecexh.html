<p>The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering and

Mines offers the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, in Computer

Engineering, and in Optical Engineering, and Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy

with a major in electrical engineering. </p>



<p>All three of the undergraduate curricula have the goal of educating immediately

productive engineers who are also qualified to pursue further education as necessary to

keep pace with these rapidly changing areas. The electrical engineering program prepares

students for careers in such areas as electronics, microelectronics, communications,

controls, electromagnetics, and signal processing. The computer engineering program

prepares students for computer-related careers including microcomputer-based design,

computer-aided VLSI design, computer networks, and artificial intelligence applications.

The optical engineering program, offered in cooperation with the Optical Sciences Center,

supports careers in areas involving optical design, optical fabrication and testing,

lasers, optical detectors, optical instrumentation, optical fiber communications, etc. </p>



<p>The department participates in the honors program. </p>

<p><a name="deg">The computer engineering program prepares students to work in the dynamic

and rapidly expanding field of digital technology. Computer engineers design computers and

computer systems, apply computers as components of larger systems, and apply digital

techniques to solving a broad range of engineering problems. The curriculum includes a

strong electrical engineering component, consisting of most of the required courses in the

electrical engineering curriculum. To this base it adds extensive course work in both the

hardware and software aspects of computers and digital systems. The program is

strengthened by the availability of extensive laboratory and computing facilities.<br>

<br>

The presence in the department of the Computer Engineering Research Laboratory, the

Computer-Aided Design Laboratory, the Digital Image Analysis Laboratory, and the

Computer-Aided Engineering Center, as well as research in artificial intelligence and

expert systems, computer communications, computer networking, simulation, and other

specialties, maintains a modern viewpoint in the undergraduate curriculum.</a></p>

to educate optical engineers who will be productive immediately upon graduation in areas

involving optical design, optical fabrication and testing, lasers, optical detectors,

optical instrumentation, optical fiber communications. This program, which is an

interdisciplinary program offered by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

and the Optical Sciences Center, has a strong electrical engineeringcomponent. The

curriculum includes many of the courses required for the B.S. degree in electrical

engineering, and qualified graduates should have little difficulty pursuing further

educational opportunities at the graduate level if desired.<br>
