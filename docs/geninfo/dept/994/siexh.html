<p>Industrial engineering focuses on the design and implementation of integrated systems

of people, materials, machines, energy and information. After first specifying system

objectives, industrial engineers combine technical knowledge and skill from the physical,

engineering and social sciences to design, implement, and operate the system. The

industrial engineer is charged with the responsibility of ensuring high quality while

simultaneously meeting cost and output goals. This is accomplished through the optimal

allocation of resources throughout the system.<br>

<br>

Industrial engineers practice in both administrative and production segments of

manufacturing and service organizations. Industrial engineers are commonly employed in

heavy industry (such as steel), medium industry (such as plastics and computers), and

light industry (such as electronics assembly), health-care delivery, telecommunications,

transportation and government. In each of these environments, industrial engineers are

involved with a variety of systems such as production planning, quality assurance,

inventory control, management information, facility layout, job/workplace design, material

flow, and distribution. The importance of manufacturing is reflected by the presence of a

manufacturing system engineering option.<br>

<br>

The modern manufacturing systems engineer designs, installs, implements, improves and

manages information-driven integrated manufacturing systems. This option prepares students

to organize, schedule, and manage the total manufacturing system, from product design

through fabrication, distribution and consumer services. </p>

<p>Systems engineers design and build systems to meet the needs of people. As computing

speed and analytic sophistication have increased, society's needs have become more varied

and complex. Graduates of the systems engineering program are prepared to face these

needs.<br>

<br>

The goal of a systems engineer is to make the best use of resources. Stated formally,

systems engineering is concerned with the processes and methodology of modeling, analyzing

and designing technologically advanced systems that function safely, effectively, and

economically. It requires appreciation and understanding of machines, people, software,

hardware, materials, and energy. Systems engineers work on a wide range of activities and

applications, including communication systems, computer networking, manufacturing systems,

robotics, transportation systems, health-care systems, societal problems and all phases of

both industrial and military research and design.To prepare students for careers of such

exceptional diversity, the systems engineering curriculum includes operations research,

probability and statistics, numerical computing methods, artificial intelligence courses,

robotics, and human factors. This is clearly a broader program than most traditional

engineering disciplines. </p>



<p>Since computing and related methodology are invariably an integral part of modern

systems engineering, the department offers a software option within the systems

engineering curriculum.
