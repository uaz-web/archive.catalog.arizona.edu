<p><font size="2">T</font><font size="3">he Bachelor of Science in Agricultural and

Biosystems Engineering emphasizes several areas including: agricultural engineering,

irrigation engineering and water resources management, bioenvironmental engineering,

biological engineering, and agri-biosystems. The program includes a basic science core

merging biological and physical sciences. Included in the major areas as appropriate are:

energy issues and alternatives; biosystems analysis and design; biotechnology engineering

developments; hazardous waste management and water quality control; soil, water, plant

relationships; applications of sensors, control systems, digital imaging, computer vision,

artificial intelligence and multispectral analysis; robotics; and other emerging

technologies. Emphasis is placed upon the design of systems, processes and equipment to

serve the engineering needs of the agricultural/biological industries and the water

resources/environmental engineering needs of various government, industry, community and

engineering consulting organizations.</font><font size="4"> </font></p>



<p><font size="3">The Bachelor of Science in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering is

accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for

Engineering and Technology.</font></p>

<h4 align="left"><em>(ABET Accredited)</em></h4>



<p align="left"><font size="3">Agricultural and biosystems engineers integrate mathematics

and the biological, physical and engineering sciences with engineering design principles.

These principles are applied to the design, analysis, construction, and management of

equipment, systems, and facilities for the efficient production, processing, and

utilization of food, fiber, and biological/biochemical products. The curriculum is based

on a core of courses required of all students with electives to place emphasis in areas

such as agricultural engineering, biological engineering, bioenvironmental engineering,

irrigation engineering and water resources management, and energy applications. Modern

developments in control systems, expert systems, robotics, sensors, microprocessors,

materials science, and computer-based analyses are emphasized throughout the program as

appropriate. The major in agricultural and biosystems engineering assumes
substantial knowledge of mathematics. </font></p>
