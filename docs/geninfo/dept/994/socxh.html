<h2 align="left"><small><small>SOCIOLOGY (SOC)</small></small></h2>

<p>Sociology is the study of human society, its origins, functions and problems. It
focuses on relations among people, groups, organizations, classes and cultures. Sociology
explores and analyzes issues vital to our personal lives, our communities, our nation, and
the world. The curriculum in sociology is designed to show students the social character
of human life and the impact of varying forms of social organization on human affairs.
Students are introduced to the methods by which knowledge is obtained, and may examine the
results of research on such diverse topics as the family, religion, education, politics
and crime. The major provides a foundation for careers in many professional fields, such
as law, criminal justice and social service, and for graduate training as a professional
sociologist in government, business, community agencies, research organizations or
educational institutions. </p>

<p><i>The major for the B.A.</i>: Majors follow either a general curriculum or a topical
program; each provides students with a theoretical overview of the discipline and the
fundamentals of its research methods and statistics. In addition, all majors are required
to take course work in each of three thematic areas: (1) organizations and institutions,
(2) social inequality, and (3) social issues and problems. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sociology majors must complete and pass the Upper Division
Writing-Proficiency-Exam (WPE) prior to enrolling in SOC 300. If a grade of &quot;U&quot;
(unsatisfactory) is earned on the WPE, the student must take and pass ENGL 397A or ENGL
397B (for international students) prior to taking SOC 300.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Garamond Antiqua">All students are strongly advised to see
their </font><a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">Degree
/ Academic Program Requirements (APRR's) </a>as early as possible in the process.
&nbsp; Students planning to declare a sociology major should discuss their plans with a
department advisor. For an advising appointment call or visit the Office of Undergraduate
Studies, Social Sciences 413A, 621-1543.&nbsp; <font FACE="Garamond Antiqua">The office is
open five days a week and administers a wide range of programs for undergraduate majors.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Preparation for Majoring or Minoring in Sociology </b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students who enjoy the greatest success in sociology typically have a
desire to gain a rigorous, critical awareness about how their own life experiences relate
to events and issues in the larger world, why certain groups have power and others do not,
how and why social change occurs, and how various social problems such as inequality,
crime, and discrimination can be improved. The best introductory sociology courses to
enroll in are SOC 101: <i>Introduction to Sociology</i>, SOC 150: <i>Sociology of Women</i>,
and SOC 260: <i>Ethnic Relations in the United States.</i></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undergraduate Scholarships, Awards</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sociology majors are quite competitive for a number of scholarships and
awards available through the UA and other organizations. These awards include: the Roger
Yoshino Award, Lorena DeSanctis McDuff Scholarship, Centennial Award, Barbara A. Hesler
Award, the College of Arts and Sciences' Distinguished Undergraduate Award, the Truman and
Rhodes Scholarships, Outstanding Senior Awards, Robert E. Baver Memorial Scholarship,
Thomas E. Campbell Award, Erdean Patterson Scholarship, and the Ruben &amp; Myron Winslow
Memorial Scholarship. Some scholarships and awards involve cash stipends. Most
scholarships require an application and letters of recommendation from faculty.</font></p>
<font FACE="Garamond Antiqua"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research/Internship Opportunities</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department offers a variety of special programs and individual
studies opportunities for its majors, including an extensive career internship program, a
legislative internship program, the Sociology Club, Alpha Kappa Delta Honorary Society,
and structured academic/career counseling for all majors in Sociology. The Department
invites undergraduates to take an active part in their own education, and encourages their
participation in the research and scholarly activities of the faculty. Undergraduates in
the Department have actively participated in faculty research projects on dispute
processing, emotions, family dynamics, juvenile delinquency, social movements, social
policy, and social power.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sociology undergraduate majors who become professional sociologists
find a variety of exciting careers in teaching, research, and practice. These careers
typically require advanced degrees (the M.A. or Ph.D.) and are not for everyone. (About 1
in 25 sociology majors at Arizona goes on to graduate school in sociology.) Most majors
find a variety of rewarding careers in government, law, and business. While the sociology
major does not provide specific training for such careers, it does provide an excellent
educational background for a variety of professional pursuits.</font>
