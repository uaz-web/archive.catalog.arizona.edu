<h2 align="center">SOCIOLOGY</h2>

<h3 align="center">(SOC)</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sociology is the study of human society, its origins, functions and problems. It
focuses on relations among people, groups, organizations, classes and cultures. Sociology
explores and analyzes issues vital to our personal lives, our communities, our nation, and
the world. The curriculum in sociology is designed to show students the social character
of human life and the impact of varying forms of social organization on human affairs.
Students are introduced to the methods by which knowledge is obtained, and may examine the
results of research on such diverse topics as the family, religion, education, politics
and crime. The major provides a foundation for careers in many professional fields, such
as law, criminal justice and social service, and for graduate training as a professional
sociologist in government, business, community agencies, research organizations or
educational institutions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>The major for the B.A.</i>: Majors follow either a general curriculum or a topical
program; each provides students with a theoretical overview of the discipline and the
fundamentals of its research methods and statistics. In addition, all majors are required
to take course work in each of three thematic areas: (1) organizations and institutions,
(2) social inequality, and (3) social issues and problems. Following completion of
required courses, qualified majors will be eligible for the Advanced Track within the
major. All others will complete the standard track of upper-division sociology courses in
the senior year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students planning to declare a sociology major should discuss their plans with a
department advisor. For an advising appointment call or visit the Office of Undergraduate
Studies, Social Sciences 413A, 621-1543.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The Advanced Track</em>: The Advanced Track consists of a year-long specialized
course tailored to the interests and career goals of the major. The first of half of the
course functions as a senior capstone in sociology, providing students the opportunity to
integrate and assimilate what they have learned through their course work in the major.
The second half of the course operates as a practicum in sociology, providing the student
an opportunity to apply or practice sociology in a work or research setting. </p>

<p>To qualify for the Advanced Track, majors must (1) complete 21 units of required course
work in the major, including completion of the core, (2) achieve a minimum grade point
average of 3.00 in the major; and (3) attain senior standing at the university. Majors not
satisfying these requirements will complete the Standard Track by taking 15 elective units
of sociology course work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Special Programs and Services</h3>

<p>Undergraduates are encouraged to become actively involved in the design of their
education, and to take advantage of the opportunities and services offered by the
department. Most of these services are available through the department's Office of
Undergraduate Services located in Social Sciences, Room 437. The office is open five days
a week and administers a wide range of programs for undergraduate majors. These programs
include: (1) a comprehensive advising system designed to aid students in choosing a major,
planning a course of study and in designing and pursuing a post-graduate career plan; (2)
an internship program designed to give eligible majors course credit for work experience
in a variety of community agencies; (3) a Majors Club designed to better integrate our
majors into the intellectual and social life of the department; (4) Alpha Kappa Delta
Sociology Honorary Association. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More information on these and other services can be obtained by visiting the office or
by reading the relevant sections in the department's <i>Handbook for Sociology Majors</i>,
available from the department.</p>
