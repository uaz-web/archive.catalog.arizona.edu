 -- Research Design and Methodologies
 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This course is aimed at exploring the relationships between theory and methods; taking students through the steps necessary for conceptualizing and performing research in cultural studies; and exploring major questions confronted by scholars in cultural studies, as well as a critical appraisal of the wide range of methodological approaches being employed to examine these questions.

A specifically critical approach to the study of method in cultural studies recognizes that knowledge (or approaches to such knowledge) are constructed and asserted by specific persons or collectivities within specific social and power relations.  A critical study of method acknowledges these social relations, including the ways in which researchers/scholars are themselves implicated in such relations.  In addition, we must be careful not to separate methods from the purposes of research.  Research questions and methods grow out of theories and, in turn, are constitutive elements in subsequent re-theorizations.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Spring.<!--CCLS560 ends-->
