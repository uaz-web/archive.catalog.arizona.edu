    <p><b>The Department:</b></p>
    <p>The Department of Family and Community Medicine is in the <a href="rm.html">College
    of Medicine</a>.</p>
  <p>The Department emphasizes the values of family and community orientation to
  medical practice. By means of preceptorships, seminars, projects, lectures,
  community assignments and clinics, and in collaboration with other
  departments, students and residents learn family medicine with expertise in
  family-centered care including issues in pregnancy, psychological care,
  geriatrics, infant and child care, minor surgery, prevention, health care
  maintenance through the life cycle and care management.</p>
  <p>A focus is training medical students in all four years how to handle the
  undifferentiated primary care patient. Family physicians are in leadership
  practice in key courses in the first two years. A required 6 week clerkship in
  the third year is followed by multiple elective and preceptorship experiences
  in the fourth year. Development of clinical teaching service resources in the
  rural and urban underserved areas of the state is reflected in programs of
  preceptorships and clerkships and other educational experiences for the
  students and residents. Many private family physicians in the community
  constitute a major teaching resource, and a variety of health-related
  institutions and programs enrich the student's experience.</p>
  <p>The Department collaborates with the Colleges of Agriculture and Life
  Sciences, Business and
  Public Administration, Nursing, Pharmacy and the School of Professions in a variety of educational, research and service efforts. The
  Department actively participates in a unique series of optional activities in
  the Commitment to Underserved People (CUP) program available to students
  beginning in their first year. By participation in such varied programs and
  experiences, medical students and residents are encouraged to understand
  family practice and to set up practices in areas of need. Special emphasis is
  given to knowledge and achievement of comprehensive quality medical care.</p>
  <p>The Department participates in the interdepartmental course, Preparation
  for Clinical Medicine (which includes physical diagnosis, interviewing,
  primary care problems and selected seminars), and in a number of elective
  interdepartmental courses, many of which are open to graduate students (see
  Electives Manual or members of the department).</p>
  <p>The Department has an approved residency in Family Practice. There is also
  an ongoing Annual Primary Care Update program of continuing education for
  community physicians developed in close collaboration with the Arizona Academy
  of Family Physicians. Fellowships in faculty development are offered.</p>
  <p>The Department serves as a hub for a statewide network of regional Area
  Health Education Centers (AHECs). The headquarters of these regional AHECs are
  located in Yuma, Miami, Nogales, Flagstaff and Phoenix. The Native American
  Research &amp; Training Center conducts health and training projects on
  reservations within the state.</p>
