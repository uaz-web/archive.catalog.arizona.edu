 -- Our Future in Space and Space in Our Future
 </b> (1)  I The aim of this colloquium is to familiarize interested participants with the exciting future in space. This will go beyond the usual gee-whiz pictures and animations that abound in the news
 media, or the spectacular pictures available on the internet sites. Through the eight major components that make up space systems, the students will be introduced to the subject as an
 integrated whole, rather than disjointed segments. After the colloquium, the informed audience will be able to make intelligent choices regarding career majors, will develop a realistic feel for
 what is involved in space ventures and missions, and how it affects the future for all of us in everyday life, here on earth. Tours of some of the unique space laboratories on campus will complement the colloquium.   Field Trips.
