 </b> (6)  I II This course is an interdepartmental, required course that is part 
of the basic science curriculum. In the same way that the traditional basic sciences serve as the background for understanding clinical medicine this course serves as the "basic science" for understanding the psychosocial and emotional aspects of clinical medicine. The student will gain knowledge and understanding of the individual as a total person, and of biological,
environmental social and psychological factors that influence that person as a patient. Also explored are age-specific life events, environmental stresses, biological processes, social behaviors that contribute to normal human development and to individual sickness, community-oriented primary care, and introduction to psychiatry and psychopathology. Panel discussions, lectures, patient interviews, small group discussions, field trips, etc., are utilized in this interdisplinary course to achieve the objectives.
Some of the topics included in the course are the doctor-patient relationship, major health problems for children and adults, substance abuse, issues in human sexuality, coping with chronic illness, health care and elderly, death and dying, ethical issues in medicine and legal aspects of medical care.   P, formal admission to the Ph.D./M.D. program, consent of instructor.

 -- Preparation for Clinical Medicine
 </b> (1) [Rpt.]  I II Preperation for Clinical Medicine is the clinical companion course to the basic sciences.The course begins the first week of medical school and continues until the beginning of the first clinical rotation. The overall objective is to provide students with skills, behavioral traits, attitudes and knowledge necessary to enter clinical clerkships. PCM is divided into three main course segments: 1. Patient evaluation, includeing physical examination clinical interviewingm speciality examinations and write-ups. During these segments students interact with patient instructors 
and also spend three semesters interviewing, specialty examinations and write-ups. During these segments students interact with patient instructors and also spend three semesters
interacting with a physician-preceptor.(LCC- longitudinal Clinical Curriculum):2. Clinical correlation's(clinical problem solving) with basic science courses; and 3. Free-standing course segments including cpr, and patient xare skills workshop. At the completion of PCM, students will have achieved a prescribed level of skill
in data collection, definition of clinical problems, and a logical approach to differential diagnosis. No grade is given until the full 12 units are completed. At the beginning of year IV, PCM administers the OSCE, a clinical competency exam required for graduation.    P, consent of instructor.
