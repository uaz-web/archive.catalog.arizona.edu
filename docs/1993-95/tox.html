Pharmacology is the science concerned with all aspects of the
actions of drugs and other chemicals on living systems. Its
primary aim is the discovery of chemical mechanisms by which
cellular and molecular functions are regulated for the purpose of
understanding how existing drugs act and to develop new drugs for
treatment of diseases. The broad scope of interests of
pharmacology ranges from the study of intermolecular reactions of
chemical constituents of cells with drugs to the effects of
chemicals in our environment on entire populations. In
conjunction with other departments in the University, the
department participates in an interdisciplinary graduate program
leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree with a major in
pharmacology and toxicology. (See Graduate Interdisciplinary
Program in Pharmacology and Toxicology). For admission and degree
requirements, please see the Graduate Catalog.

Toxicology is the science concerned with the harmful effects of
chemicals (including drugs) on living systems. The toxicology
program offers a curriculum leading to the Master of Science
degree with a major in toxicology. The program prepares students
for careers in hospital laboratories, police crime laboratories,
medical examiners' offices, industrial hygiene laboratories, and
toxicology laboratories in industry, government, and
universities. The broad scope of interests in toxicology ranges
from determining the mechanisms by which chemicals produce
adverse biological effects to identification, and quantification
of hazards resulting from occupational and/or environmental
exposure to chemicals. For admission and degree requirements,
please see the Graduate Catalog.

Industrial hygiene is the applied science concerned with the
anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control of chemical
and physical agents that can affect health status in occupational
and environmental settings. An industrial hygiene concentration
is offered within the M.S. toxicology program. The concentration
prepares students for professional practice in a wide range of
both private and public sector organizations. For admission and
degree requirements, please see the Graduate Catalog.

The department participates in the honors program.

The Graduate Interdisciplinary Program in Pharmacology and
Toxicology offers a graduate program leading to the Doctor of
Philosophy degree with a major in pharmacology and toxicology.
The program has a faculty of forty-one from the departments of
Pharmacology, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Anesthesiology, Cancer
Center, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Radiation Oncology,
Surgery, Internal Medicine, and the Arizona Research Laboratory.
Faculty members have research interests in carcinogenesis/cancer
chemotherapy, cardiovascular pharmacology, endocrine
pharmacology, environmental toxicology, immunopharmacology,
molecular/biochemical pharmacology, molecular toxicology,
neuropharmacology, and toxicology. Students in the Ph.D. program
may choose a major track in pharmacology or toxicology; several
areas of concentration are available in either track. The Ph.D.
degree is awarded upon successful completion of a research
project that culminates in an original and significant scientific
contribution.

For course descriptions, please see entries in this catalog for
Pharmacology (Department, College of Medicine) and Pharmacology
and Toxicology (Department, College of Pharmacy). For information
on graduate programs and admission requirements, please see the
Graduate Catalog.
