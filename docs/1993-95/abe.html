Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering (ABE)
The Bachelor of Science in Agricultural and Biosystems
Engineering emphasizes several areas including: agricultural
engineering, irrigation engineering and water resources
management, bioenvironmental engineering, biological engineering,
and agri-biosystems power and machine systems. The program
emphasizes a base science program merging biological and physical
sciences. Included in the major areas as appropriate are: energy
issues and alternatives; biosystems analysis and design;
biotechnology engineering developments; hazardous waste
management and water quality control; soil, water, plant
relationships; applications of sensors, control systems, digital
imaging, computer vision, artificial intelligence and
multispectral analysis; robotics; and other emerging
technologies. Emphasis is placed upon the design of systems,
processes and equipment to serve the engineering needs of the
agricultural/biological industries and the water
resources/environmental engineering needs of various government,
industry, community, and engineering consulting organizations.

The Bachelor of Science in Agricultural and Biosystems
Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation
Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and
Technology.
