The Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences prepares students
for careers in basic and clinical sciences (speech-language
pathology, audiology, speech science, and hearing science) in
university, laboratory, medical, public school, or other clinical
settings. Professional certification in the state of Arizona and
with the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association requires
graduate study with the acquisition of a Master of Science
degree.

The department offers the following degrees: Bachelor of Science
in Speech and Hearing Sciences, Master of Science and Doctor of
Philosophy with a major in speech and hearing sciences. For
graduate admission and degree requirements, consult the Graduate
Catalog.

The major: The major requires 30 units, including 260, 280, 367,
370a-370b and 483 and 496a.

In addition to the general education requirements for the B.S.
degree as described in the College of Arts and Sciences section
of this catalog, the department requires one course in
mathematics or statistics beyond college algebra and 8 hours in a
laboratory science course beyond the minimum requirement. A 20-
unit minor is also required. Students enrolled in the American
Indian Professional Training program should consult with their
advisors regarding the mathematics and science requirements. At
least 24 units in the major must be university credit. Minimum
total units for the degree with this major--125.
