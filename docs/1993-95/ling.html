The Department of Linguistics offers instruction in introductory,
intermediate, and advanced topics in phonology, syntax, and
semantics. It also offers course work in Native American
languages of the Southwest (e.g., Navajo and O'odham) and courses
on the native languages of North America. Undergraduate majors in
linguistics can expect to be prepared to undertake professional
graduate studies in linguistics and related areas or to pursue
careers in such language related fields as education, publishing,
and certain sectors of business.

The Department of Linguistics offers programs leading to a
Bachelor of Arts, a Master of Arts, and a Doctor of Philosophy
with a major in linguistics. For graduate admission and degree
requirements, please see the Graduate Catalog.

The major for the Bachelor of Arts: 30 units, including 201, 300,
310 and 315, and one year of work in an uncommonly taught
language (e.g., Greek, Latin, Russian, or any non-Indo-European
language). The remainder is to be selected in consultation with
the undergraduate advisor.

Majors are urged to continue their foreign language study beyond
the minimum 16 units required by the college.

Course work for the supporting minor is selected in consultation
with the undergraduate advisor. A minor in linguistics requires a
minimum of 20 units including 101 or 201, and two of 300, 310 and
315.
