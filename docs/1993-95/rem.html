Remote sensing concerns the collection of information related in
some way to the Earth's natural resources or environment. Data
are primarily collected by satellite and aircraft systems in
conjunction with localized ground-based surveys and measurements.
The data are processed by digital computer or optical techniques
to extract information of value to earth scientists and resource
and environment managers at the local, state, and federal levels.

The Program in Remote Sensing offers no major at the present time
but minor programs are available for doctoral students with
majors in disciplines within the colleges of Agriculture, Arts
and Sciences, Business and Public Administration, Engineering and
Mines; and in Arid Lands Studies and Optical Sciences. For
further information concerning the minor, please see the Graduate
Catalog.
