The American Indian Studies Program does not offer a
baccalaureate degree. A minor is available and the AINS director
can assist students who are interested in American Indian Studies
and are pursuing the interdisciplinary studies major (IDS).

The minor in American Indian studies consists of at least 20
units (or appropriate units as designated by the major degree
program) selected by the student in consultation with the
Director of American Indian Studies and approved by the student's
major professor. The minor provides a wide range of instruction
in the history, culture, lifeways, and contemporary problems of
native people. American Indian students are provided with basic
information on their cultural heritage and its significance in
the contemporary world. Non-native students can obtain greater
appreciation for the lifeways and value systems of American
Indians.

A Master of Arts with a major in American Indian studies is also
available. For admission and degree requirements, please see the
Graduate Catalog.
