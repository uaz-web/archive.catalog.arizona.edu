The Department of Political Science offers courses on the
philosophies, processes, organizations, methods, and policies of
government and related political institutions. These courses
focus on government and politics in the United States and foreign
countries and also on how governments of different nations relate
to one another. Political science instruction is useful for
pursuing careers in government, politics, law, business,
education, journalism, and the media.

The department offers the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master of
Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy with a major in political science.
A Bachelor of Arts in Education and a Master of Education with a
teaching major in political science are also available. For
information on graduate degrees, please see the Graduate Catalog.

The major: Thirty units of course work in political science must
be taken, including 102 and at least one of the following: 100,
120, 140, 160. At least 18 units of this course work must be
upper-division courses (300- and 400-level courses). Individual
study cannot be used to satisfy this 18-unit requirement.
Students must also take courses from five of the six fields of
study listed below.

The minor: Twenty units of course work must be taken with a
concentration in one of the six subfields recognized by the
department. No fewer than 12 hours shall be taken in one
subfield; 102, 120, 140 or 160 may be included as part of the 12
hours. At least nine units in the minor must be upper division.

The teaching minor: Twenty units of course work in political
science must be taken. Of the total twenty units, twelve must be
taken in one of the six subfields. In addition, one of the lower-
division courses -- 100, 102, 120, 130, or 160 -- must be within
the appropriate subfield.

Teacher certification: The U.S. and Arizona Constitutions
requirement for a teacher's certificate may be satisfied by two
course options: 102, 130; 102, 214. An additional option is the
constitutions examination, which carries no university credit.

Fields of study: The department is divided into six substantive
areas or fields of study. These fields of study, with appropriate
course listings, are as follows: (1) American Political
Institutions: 205, 206, 214, 231, 280, 290, 309, 406, 407, 412;
(2) Political Behavior: 330, 332, 334, 355, 431, 432, 434, 435,
436, 487; (3) Law and Public Policy: 206, 350, 388, 405, 470,
471, 474, 475, 476, 480, 481, 483, 484a-484b, 485; (4) Political
Theory: 328, 335, 421, 422, 423, 426, 427; (5) Comparative

449, 450, 453, 468; and (6) International Relations: 250, 451,
452, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 461, 464.

Special programs: Majors interested in law, civil service, or
foreign service should consult the department's career advisors
regarding an appropriate course of study. Internships are offered
in connection with the State Legislature, the Public Defender,
the Juvenile Court, administrative agencies of the City of Tucson
and Pima County, and the U.S. Congress. Three credits of
internship can be counted toward the minimum thirty units for the
major. It does not fulfill the upper-division or sub-field
requirements for the major. Prelaw students interested in legal
problems of American Indians may combine prelaw and American
Indian policy courses in the Department of Political Science with
the minor in American Indian studies.
