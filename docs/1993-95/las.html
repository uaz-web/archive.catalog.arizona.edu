The Latin American Area Center offers an interdisciplinary
program designed primarily for students planning government,
business, teaching, or other careers. The center offers a
Bachelor of Arts degree, a Master of Arts degree, and a doctoral
minor in Latin American studies. A student with an interest in
the Latin American area selects a concentration in one department
and enriches that concentration with related studies, cultural or
professional, in other departments.

Undergraduate students majoring in Latin American Studies must
complete a minimum of 30 upper-division units for the major. At
least 12 of these must come from a concentration in one of the
following areas:  anthropology, art history, geography and
regional development, history, political science, Portuguese, or
Spanish. A maximum of 18 upper-division units, with no fewer than
six in any one area, must be selected from two or three areas
offering related studies: agricultural economics, anthropology,
art history, economics, geography and regional development,
history, journalism, political science, Portuguese, sociology, or
Spanish.

At some point in their programs students must also take the
interdisciplinary Latin American Studies colloquium (LA S 495a).
Depending on its subject matter, this course may be counted
toward their area of concentration or toward one of their related
studies. Competence in Portuguese or Spanish is required and may
be demonstrated by completing Portuguese 206 or Spanish 251b with
a grade of B or by an equivalency exam.

Although most Latin American studies-related courses do not have
prerequisites, students planning to major in the field are
strongly advised to take some of the introductory and survey
courses related to Latin America at the lower-division level. In
all cases, students majoring or minoring in Latin American
studies should consult with an advisor at the Latin American Area
Center early in their undergraduate programs.

For graduate admission and degree requirements, students should
consult the Graduate Catalog.

The department participates in the honors program.
