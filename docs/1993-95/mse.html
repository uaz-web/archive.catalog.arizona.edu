Materials science is the science of the structure, properties and
behavior of metals, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, and
composite materials. The materials scientist strives to expand
knowledge of the properties of existing materials and to develop
new materials.

Materials engineering emphasizes the fundamental knowledge
necessary to select, process, and apply materials for societal
needs. The materials engineer strives to transform materials for
practical use.

More than one-fourth of all scientists and engineers are involved
in the science or engineering of materials, indicating that
almost every field in science and engineering uses materials.
Recognizing the importance of materials in nearly every aspect of
technology, the University of Arizona has committed its resources
to expanding the Department of MSE. A wide range of courses,
covering the many facets of MSE, is now offered at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels.

The department offers the degrees of Bachelor of Science in
Materials Science and Engineering, Master of Science with a major
in materials science and engineering, and Doctor of Philosophy
with a major in materials science and engineering.
