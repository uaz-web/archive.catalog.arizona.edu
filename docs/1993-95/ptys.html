The Department of Planetary Sciences offers a multidisciplinary
program leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy
degrees with a major in planetary science.

Earth science teaching major: Students interested in teaching
secondary school earth science, which includes planetary
sciences, should see the list of required courses under
Department of Geosciences.

Undergraduate students may obtain a minor in Planetary Sciences.
The PTYS minor must include PTYS 403, 411, and six other upper-
division units in Planetary Science. The remaining units are
chosen by the student and major advisor subject to final approval
by the Planetary Sciences Curriculum Committee.
