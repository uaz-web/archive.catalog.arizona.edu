The Department of Art provides a broad spectrum of theoretical,
historical, and creative programs of instruction designed to
prepare students for professional careers in studio art, graphic
design and illustration, art history, and art education.

The department offers the following degrees:  Bachelor of Fine
Arts with majors in studio art and art education, and Bachelor of
Arts in Art with a major in art history.  The graduate degrees of
Master of Fine Arts and Master of Arts are also available.  For
graduate admission and degree requirements, please consult the
Graduate Catalog.

The major in studio art is for students planning professional
careers as creative artists. The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree
requires 45 units to be taken outside of the major department,
including the general education requirements described under the
College of Arts and Sciences/Faculty of Fine Arts in this
catalog.  All BFA students are also required to take at least one
3-unit course specifically focused on gender, race, ethnicity, or
non-western civilization. In addition, the student must complete
80 units in art, at least 18 of which must be at the University
of Arizona.  These 80 units in art are subdivided as follows:

Foundations requirements -- 15 units: 101, 102, 104, ARH 117,
118.

Distribution requirements -- 30 units:  2-Dimensional Studies: 9-
12 units chosen from 205, 241, 250, 251, 253, 255, 265, 266, 280,
285.  3-Dimensional Studies: 6-9 units chosen from 271, 273, 276,
287. Art history: 9-12 units of upper-division art history and/or
related courses.

Major area of concentration -- 24 units in any one emphasis area:

2-D studio emphasis in drawing, painting, the printmaking, or an
approved combination: 24 units of upper-division studio art
courses.

3-D studio emphasis in sculpture, ceramics, fibers, or metals: 24
units of upper-division courses including 15 units in primary
medium and 3 units in each of 2 secondary media.

be approved in writing by the primary area coordinator.

Art electives -- 11 units from other courses in art, 6 of which
must be upper division.

The major in art education is for students planning to teach art
in the elementary and secondary schools.  Graduates qualify for
the K-12 Art Specialist Endorsement on a Secondary Certificate
for the State of Arizona. This program approximates certification
requirements of most states. At least 12 units of art must be
taken at the University of Arizona.

In addition to the general education requirements for the
Bachelor of Fine Arts degree described under the College of Arts
and Sciences/Faculty of Fine Arts in this catalog, the following
major area of study requirements must be met:  Foundations
courses and Distribution courses as described in the major in
studio art requirements (above). Students must take 10 units in
art education concepts and methods, along with 12 units of upper-
division art education and/or studio and art history upon
approval of art education advisor. The prerequisites for entry
into the art education program include the following: acceptance
both by the Art Department and the College of Education, passing
scores on College of Education designated admission test, an
interview and portfolio review. TTE 300, and EDUC 350 are
prerequisites for the 10 units of art education concepts and
methods. The candidate for the degree with this major must also
complete other required College of Education units (see Teaching
and Teacher Education) and student teaching (TTE 493b). A
teaching minor is not required, but those students anticipating
employment in areas where a teaching minor might be advantageous
should consult with their advisor. The student should also
consult with his or her advisor regarding any possible changes in
certification requirements and consequent adjustments to degree
requirements. Minimum total units required for the degree with
this major -- 126.

The major in art history is for students planning professional
careers in art history or seeking an essentially cultural
undergraduate education. This program provides an appropriate
basis for advanced study of art history at the graduate level. To
qualify for the degree with this major, 9 units of art (6 units
specifically in the history of art) must be taken in residence at
the University of Arizona.

In addition to the general education requirements for the
Bachelor of Arts degree described under the College of Art and
Sciences/Faculty of Fine Arts in this catalog, the student must
complete a 34-unit major and a 20-unit minor.  The following
requirements for the major must be met: ART 101, ARH 117, 118 and
18 units of upper-division art history, and 7 units of elective
art courses -- 14 units in the last two areas shall be upper-
division courses.  (See the Faculty of Fine Arts section of this
catalog for more information on single or split minors).  Minimum
total units required for the degree with this major -- 125.
