The Department of French and Italian offers language instruction
at the elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels. In
addition, courses (taught in their respective languages) are
offered in the literature and culture of France and of Italy and
in business French. Study abroad options include programs in
Florence and in Paris.

Undergraduate majors in French or Italian attain a command of the
language and a knowledge of the culture that can prepare them to
teach at the secondary level or to undertake postgraduate studies
in French or Italian, or to pursue careers in international
business or in the foreign service. Departmental majors selecting
the latter option may combine language study with a thematic
business minor in the College of Business and Public
Administration, concentrating in general business, management, or
marketing. This option provides a solid foundation of marketable
skills for careers in international business and finance,
communications and technology, government and administration.

Degree Programs: Bachelor of Arts with a major in French
(concentrations in French literature and culture, or in business
French or in teaching); Bachelor of Arts with a major in Italian;
Master of Arts with a major in French; and Doctor of Philosophy
with a major in French. An option at the M.A. level is the
program in Francophone studies, focusing on the cultural
originality and vitality of French-speaking areas outside of
France (Quebec, Belgium, the Maghreb, Black Africa, the
Caribbean). Doctoral minors are offered in Italian, French and
Francophone literatures, and interdisciplinary programs are
available in conjunction with women's studies, the graduate
interdisciplinary programs in comparative cultural and literary
studies, and the program in second language acquisition and
teaching.

Writing-Emphasis Courses: Because writing in all upper-division
courses is in the language of instruction (French or Italian),
the requirement will be satisfied through completion of at least
one 3-unit course designated as a Writing-Emphasis Course within
the department (see &quot;Writing-Emphasis Courses&quot; in the Academic
Policies and Graduation Requirements section of this catalog).
Consult an undergraduate advisor.

The department participates in the honors program and offers
honors sections of selected courses. Inquire with the
departmental honors advisor.
