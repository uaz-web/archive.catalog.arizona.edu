The science of anthropology is the study of human beings, their
origins, thought, and behavior. The Department of Anthropology
offers graduate and undergraduate course work in four
subdisciplines: cultural anthropology, physical anthropology,
archaeology, and linguistic anthropology, as well as specialized
training for field research. Special programs in museum studies,
cultural resource management, and forensic anthropology draw upon
the extensive resources of the Arizona State Museum. The Bureau
of Applied Research in Anthropology is a center for applied
anthropological research in the American Southwest and similar
multicultural and ecological settings elsewhere in the world. The
department cooperates with the Arizona Health Sciences Center in
offering a program in medical anthropology.

The degrees offered by the department are the Bachelor of Arts,
Master of Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy with a major in
anthropology.

The major for the B.A. requires a minimum of 36 units of
anthropology, 18 of which must be in upper-division courses. All
majors must take 101, 102, 200, 235, 265, and 276, which provide
the student with basic training in all four subdisciplines. The
student may then select one of three programs: (1) a general
program which requires one upper-division course in each of the
four subdisciplines plus two additional upper-division courses (a
minimum of six courses); (2) a special program which requires
three upper-division courses in each of two subdisciplines (a
minimum of six courses); or (3) a topical or areal specialization
approved by the undergraduate advisor (a minimum of six upper-
division courses).

The supporting minor may be chosen from any department or program
within the University.

The department participates in the Honors Program.
