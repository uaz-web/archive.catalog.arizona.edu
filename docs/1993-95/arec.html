The department's program is designed to relate agricultural and
resource problems and issues in contemporary society to their
underlying economic explanations. Through the choice of elective
courses the major in agricultural and resource economics may
build programs in: agricultural business to prepare for careers
in the management of farms, ranches and agribusiness firms;
economic development for careers in rural area development and
foreign agricultural development; resource economics for careers
in the management of public resources of land and water; and
preparation for graduate study for careers in business, teaching
and research.

The following degrees are offered: Bachelor of Science in
Agriculture with a major in agricultural and resource economics
and Master of Science with a major in agricultural and resource
economics. The Doctor of Philosophy degree with a major in
economics and an emphasis in agricultural and resource economics
is administered by the combined faculties of the departments of
Economics and Agricultural and Resource Economics.

The major: Undergraduate majors must complete the general
education requirements as described in the College of Agriculture
section of the catalog. Courses in four of the five required
study areas must be selected from a departmentally approved list.
Included in this list are MATH 119 and 123, ECON 201a, 201b, 330
and AREC 242. Additional requirements include ACCT 200, either
ECON 300 or 361, and ECON 332 and a minimum of 22 units in upper-
division agricultural and resource economics courses. Majors must
choose additional coursework from options in either Agricultural
Economics, Agribusiness Management, or Resource and Environmental
Economics.

Agricultural Economics Option:  This option is designed for the
student interested in the application of economics to societal
problems. AREC 339, 403, 404 and 464 are required.  Forty-one
units of elective credit are open to the student.

Agribusiness Management Option:  Designed for the student
interested in the management of agricultural production,
marketing/sales and service business. In addition to the above
general requirements, ACCT 210, 310 and MAP 330 are required.
Students taking this option must also complete AREC 213, 215,

to enroll in additional relevant courses in the College of
Business and Public Administration.

Resource and Environmental Economics Option:  This option meets
the needs of the student interested in the economic analysis of
environmental and natural resource issues facing society. In
addition to the general requirements, AREC 217, 339, 350, 375,
403, 404, 464, and 476 are required. Students are encouraged to
use 44 elective units in courses relating to biology, political
science and natural resource management.

The minor: A minimum of 20 units of course work is required in
agricultural economics. At least 19 units must be selected from
ACCT 200, AREC 213, 215, 217 and ECON 300, 330 or 361. A minimum
of 12 upper-division units must be selected from a list of
