The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers courses in
language skills, linguistics, pedagogy, grammar and composition,
literature, and culture. There is an alternate track designed
especially for native speakers of Spanish with courses in
language and culture, culminating in creative writing and a
variety of classes in Mexican and Mexican-American literature.
The department provides academic direction in summer programs in
Spanish at the Guadalajara Summer School in Mexico, in summer and
year programs in Spain, and in Portuguese in a semester program
in Rio de Janeiro.

The department offers programs leading to the following degrees:
Bachelor of Arts with a major in Spanish, with a specialization
in either language and culture or in Hispanic language and
linguistics; or the Bachelor of Arts with a major in Portuguese,
with a specialization in language and literature; the Bachelor of
Arts in Education with a teaching major in Spanish; Master of
Arts with a major in Spanish, and an emphasis in either
literature or language and linguistics; the Master of Arts in
Education with a teaching major in Spanish; and the Doctor of
Philosophy with a major in Spanish. For further information
regarding the graduate programs, please consult the Graduate
Catalog.

The major in Spanish for the B.A. shall consist of 36 upper-
division units, consisting of two qualifying courses of three
units each, plus 30 upper-division units, with a primary
concentration in either language and linguistics or in language
and literature (eight courses minimum) and a secondary emphasis
(two courses minimum) in the alternate area.

Contact the department for specific course requirements.

In the language and literature concentration all students will
complete three survey courses: 400, 401 and 403. A senior thesis
in literature is an option for the literature major, and is under
the direction of a student-selected faculty mentor. The course
will be devoted to the creation of an original research paper by
the student, and is conceived as an introduction to literary
research methods and materials by the faculty mentor.

The complementary language/linguistic component shall consist of
425 or 450, and one linguistics course.

The language and linguistics concentration courses are being
revised. Please contact the department for specific requirements.

The complementary literature component shall consist of 350 and
either 400, 401 or 403.

The major in Portuguese for the B.A. shall consist of 30 units,
beginning with 206 or higher

The supporting minor for majors in Spanish or Portuguese:
recommended subjects are classics, drama, English, philosophy,
other modern languages, humanities, history and theory of art or
music, journalism, speech, anthropology, political science,
business, economics, history, linguistics, psychology, sociology,
or other subjects as may be individually justified.

The teaching major for the B.A. in Education: 24 units in upper-
division Spanish to include the following courses: 340, 350, 425
or 450, and one of the literature surveys (400, 401, or 403) and
one of the cultural surveys (430, 431 and 457 or 473.

The teaching minor for the B.A. in Education: 20 units in
Spanish, including 325, 340, and 350.

Spanish 101, 102, 201, 202 and Portuguese 101, 102 are for the
student who is learning a second language. Spanish and Portuguese
205 and 206 are for the student who has already learned a second
language, preferably a Romance language. SPAN 203, 253a-253b,
323, 333, comprise the alternate track in communication skills
for native speakers of Spanish.

Students will be placed in the proper class level according to
one or more of the following factors: previous experience or
study, departmental placement examinations, individual
counseling. Placement examinations are given during the summer to
incoming freshmen and during the week of registration preceding
the fall and the spring semesters to all students in need of
advising or placement. Non-credit proficiency examinations are
available during registration and the first week of classes for
students interested in challenging 300-level language courses; no
credit or grade is given for this type of intra-departmental
examination. Consult an undergraduate advisor. For information
about proficiency examinations with credit, consult the Academic
Policies and Graduation Requirements section of this catalog.

The four-semester language proficiency requirement may be
satisfied by completing with a passing grade SPAN 202, 203, 206
or PORT 206. It may also be satisfied by placing in the fifth
semester on the departmental placement examination or through
Advanced Placement examinations. Once a course in a grammar or
language-skill sequence is successfully completed, no lower
numbered course taken subsequently in that sequence will count
toward the major.

Writing-Emphasis Course: Since writing in all upper-division
courses is in either Spanish or Portuguese, the completion of
either 325 or 425 will constitute the fulfillment of a bilingual
proficiency in composition.

The department participates in the honors program.

For further information, contact your advisor and those of the
Department of Spanish and Portuguese.
