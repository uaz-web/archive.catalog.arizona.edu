The Department of Microbiology and Immunology offers a course of
study applicable to general and applied sciences in agriculture,
allied health, biology and medicine. The major provides a strong
foundation for graduate study in microbiology, immunology,
molecular biology and genetics, as well as a preprofessional
program for students seeking admission to schools of medicine and
dentistry.

The department offers the Master of Science and Doctor of
Philosophy degrees with majors in microbiology and immunology.
For graduate admission and degree requirements consult the
Graduate Catalog.
