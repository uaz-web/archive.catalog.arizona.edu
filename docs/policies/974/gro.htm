<h2 align="center">Repeating a Course and GRO</h2>

<p>Students wishing to repeat course work at The University of Arizona may elect one of
the following options: </p>

<h3>Establishment of Credit </h3>

<p>Undergraduate students may repeat any course for which they have received an E or W.
They may repeat this course as many times as necessary to establish credit, but may only
be eligible for grade replacement once. </p>

<h3>First and Second Attempt Averaging</h3>

<p>Undergraduate students may repeat only once any course in which they have received
original grades of C or D. Grade-point average will be computed by averaging grades earned
in the first and second attempt. Original grades of A or B may not be repeated, except as
specifically provided by departments on a course-by-course basis. Credit will be allowed
only once unless the course is designated &quot;repeatable for credit&quot; by the
department.<font size="1"> </font></p>

		<h4 align="center">Grade Replacement Opportunity (GRO)</h4>
		<p align="left"><b>Graduate Students:</b></p>
		<p>Graduate students may now apply to retake courses for which they 
		received a grade of C or below.&nbsp; Application forms and policy details 
		are available in the Graduate College's Degree Certification Office, 
		(520) 621-3609.</p>
		<p><b>Undergraduate Students:</b></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Undergraduates who have not received a bachelor&#8217;s degree from 
			this University may repeat under the Grade Replacement Opportunity (GRO), 
			only once, certain courses in which they received
			<a href="../../2006-07/policies/grade.htm">grades</a> of C, D, or E. 
			</li>
			<li>The repeat GRO attempt department, course number, and grading 
			type must be identical to the first attempt. 
			<ol type="a">
				<li>The use of GRO for Tier Two courses is limited to courses 
				with the same title and course number.&nbsp; GRO of Tier One courses 
				will be limited to courses with the same title <b>and</b> 
				subtitle, as well as the same course number. 
				</li>
				<li>The use of GRO to replace UA main campus courses with UA 
				South courses or vice versa, is limited to courses with a 
				corresponding course prefix (e.g., ANTH-UA main prefix, and 
				ANTV-UA South prefix), the same course number and title, and 
				which have been determined to be equivalent as indicated in the 
				Catalog course description. </li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>&quot;Credit by Exam&quot;, &quot;Grade by Exam&quot;, &quot;Individual Studies&quot; courses, 
			&quot;Correspondence&quot; courses, and &quot;Pass/Fail&quot; courses cannot be taken 
			under GRO. Individual Studies is defined as courses with numbers 
			ending in 91 (Preceptorship), 92 (directed research), 93 (internship), 94 (practicum), and 
			99 (independent study). 
			</li>
			<li>A total of 3 courses, not to exceed a maximum of 10 semester 
			hours, may be repeated under GRO. 
			</li>
			<li>A GRO repeated course grade will replace only one previous 
			grade. (Example: if a course has been graded more than once, the GRO 
			repeated course grade will replace only one of the graded courses.) 
			</li>
			<li><b>Students must file a
			<a href="http://registrar.arizona.edu/academics/grade-replacement-opportunity-gro">
			GRO request form</a> in the Office of the Registrar</b>, 
			Administration Building, Room 210.&nbsp; The request form is available 
			only during GRO filing periods. See the exact

			Information</a> page. 
			</li>
			<li>The repeated attempt under GRO is the grade used in the 
			calculation of the <a href="../../2006-07/policies/gpa.htm">
			grade-point-average (GPA)</a>, even if lower than the first attempt, 
			except in the case of #8 below. Both grades earned in the first and 
			the GRO repeat attempts will remain on the academic record. If a 
			student passes the first attempt, but fails the repeat attempt, the 
			failing grade is calculated in the grade-point-average; however the 
			units earned in the first attempt may be applied toward degree 
			requirements. 
			</li>
			<li>GRO repeat attempt grades of O, W, WP, WF, WO or XO will count 
			as attempts, but will not replace the grade in the first attempt. 
			</li>
			<li>When the final grade for the GRO repeat attempt has been 
			processed in the Office of the Registrar, the cumulative 
			grade-point-average will be adjusted. Grades of I, K, and Y are not 
			final grades. 
			</li>
			<li>Total earned units will not be affected by GRO, duplicate earned 
			units resulting from GRO cannot be applied towards a degree program. 
			</li>
			<li>University, college or department policies or certain 
			circumstances may limit the option to use the Grade Replacement 
			Opportunity. Neither the department nor the Office of the Registrar 
			is responsible for the loss of this opportunity due to changes in 
			course offerings, such as course cancellation, unit change, time 
			change, etc.
