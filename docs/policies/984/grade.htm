<h3>Regular and Special Grades </h3>

<p>A,B,C,D, and E constitute the regular grades used at the University of Arizona.
All individual
studies courses and some small group courses with S (superior) and P (pass) use special
grades which replace A and B grades. For explanation of these grades, see entries for
these courses in <a href="../../faculty/courses/984/crsdesc.htm">How to Read Course Descriptions</a>. </p>

<p>For the grading systems available in honors individual studies courses, see the <a href="../../faculty/courses/984/honr.html">Honors Center Course Descriptions</a>. </p>

<p><b>Pass/Fail Option</b> </p>

<p>For certain courses, a qualified student may elect to register under the pass/fail
option. Under such registration, the only final grades available to the student are P
(pass) or F (fail). </p>

<p>Undergraduate students may elect to take courses under the pass/fail option only after
they have attained sophomore standing and only if they have earned grade-point averages of
2.000 or better. </p>

<p>Students registering for a course under the pass/fail option must meet the
prerequisites or otherwise satisfy the instructor of their ability to take the course. </p>

<p>Undergraduate students may register under the pass/fail option for not more than two
courses per semester up to a maximum of 12 courses. Further, they must carry a minimum of
12 units of regular grades other than P/F during each semester in which they elect courses
under the pass/fail option. Any exceptions to this policy must be approved by the
student's academic dean. </p>

<p>Courses taken under the pass/fail option must be electives only, and may not be used to
fulfill major, minor, or other specified curriculum requirements. </p>

<p>The pass/fail option is not generally available to graduate students. The only
exceptions to this proscription are: (a) admission deficiencies which the student has
prior specific, written approval to take on a P/F basis (only the department head or the
departmental graduate adviser may give such approval, which must be on file in the
Graduate College office before registration); (b) any undergraduate non-deficiency course
available for P/F grading; and (c) any course offered by the College of Law. </p>

<p>Each department decides which of its courses will be available under the pass/fail
option. Pass/fail courses in the 500, 600, or 700 series may be offered only in law.
Further, the instructor of the course must approve of its being offered pass/fail. The
instructor shall be informed by the Registrar which students are enrolled under the
pass/fail option. </p>

<p>Students may change from pass/fail enrollment to enrollment for a regular grade, or
vice versa, only during the time period prior to the last day of the fourth calendar week
during which classes are held, except with special permission of the student's college
dean. </p>

<p>If a course is taken under the pass/fail option, the grade of P or F will be
permanently recorded. However, neither grade will be included in the average. If the
course is passed, the units of credit will be applied toward graduation. </p>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>COLLEGE OF MEDICINE</i></strong></font> - All courses
in the College of Medicine are graded on a pass/fail system for medical students. </p>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION</i></strong></font> -
Pass/fail grades are the only grades available for 493a and 493b. Enrollment in these
courses will not reduce the amount for which a student can otherwise enroll under the
pass/fail option. </p>

of Incomplete Grade</a> form as a contract with the student as to what course 
work must be completed by the student for the <b>I</b> grade to be removed and 
replaced with a grade. On the form, the instructor states:&nbsp; (1) which 
assignments or exams should be completed and when; (2) how this work will be 
graded; and (3) how the student's course grade will be calculated. Both the 
instructor and student sign this agreement and both should retain copies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">After the course work is completed, the instructor 
should assign the appropriate grade on a Change of Grade form and submit it to 
the Office of the Registrar for processing. After processing, the new grade will 
be included in the calculation of the GPA.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">If the incomplete grade is not removed by the 
instructor within one year (the last day of finals one year later), the <b>I</b> 
grade will convert to a failing grade. For undergraduate courses, the one-year 
limit may be extended for one additional year if, prior to converting to an E, 
the extension is approved by the instructor and the dean of the college in which 
the student is registered. This extension requires the instructor and dean's 
signature on a Petition for Extension of Course Work.&nbsp; Notification of the 
dean's approval or denial is to be provided to the student by the dean's 
office.&nbsp; A copy of the approved or denied Petition must then be forwarded from 
the dean's office to the Office of the Registrar, Administration 210, for 
appropriate processing.&nbsp; Once the <b>I</b><i> </i>has converted to an <b>E</b>, 
a one-year extension will only be considered if the student submits an appeal to 
the University General Petition Committee.&nbsp; Additionally, a request for an 
extension of time beyond 2 academic years of the original course enrollment 
requires approval by the General Petition Committee.&nbsp; For courses taken for 
graduate credit, such approval may be granted only by the Graduate College.</span></p>

<p><b>Course in Progress</b> </p>

<p>The grade of K may be awarded by the instructor for 900-level courses when the course
continues for longer than one semester. Students must re-enroll for these courses each
semester. K grades remain on the student's permanent record until removed with a final
grade but do not enter into the calculation of the grade-point average. Time-limit for
completion of such work for full credit for the master's degree is six years; for the
doctoral degree, ten years. </p>

<p>The grade of K is assigned for all supplementary registration (930) at the time of
enrollment and will remain permanently on the student's academic record. </p>

<p>For any course, other than the 900 series, that requires more than one semester for
completion, the grade of K is awarded by the Office of the Registrar at the end of the
semester and carried to the next semester. </p>

<h4><strong>Withdrawal Grade W: Dropping a Course </strong></h4>

<p>Prior to the end of the fourth week of classes, official withdrawal (drop) of a course
cancels the registration for the course. A dean&#146;s approval is not required. No grade
for the course will appear on the student&#146;s permanent record. During weeks five
through eight, the grade of W is awarded to students who are passing at the time of
withdrawal. The grade of E may be awarded to students not passing at the time of
withdrawal. Either W or E will show on the student&#146;s permanent record. </p>

<p>After the eighth week of classes, the grade of W can be awarded only with the approval
of the student&#146;s academic dean, and only under exceptional circum-stances. The W may
also be awarded in the case of complete withdrawal from the University.</p>

<h4>Withdrawal Grades W/P, W/F: Complete Withdrawal from the University</h4>

<p>In the case of complete withdrawal from the University, if a student withdraws before
the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> week of classes in Fall/Spring (end of the 1<sup>st</sup>
week in a Summer term), no classes show on the student's transcript for the semester/term.
If a student withdraws from the University between the 5<sup>th</sup> week of classes in
Fall/Spring (2<sup>nd</sup> week in a Summer term) and the last day of classes for the
semester/term, the faculty member for each course may assign a grade of W/P (withdrawal
while passing), or W/F (withdrawal while failing). Neither grade is used to calculate the
GPA. The refund schedule is listed for each semester/term in the Schedule of Classes.</p>

<p><b>Audit Grade</b> </p>

<p>The grade of O is awarded for courses taken for audit. This grade is not awarded unless
the student is registered for audit. </p>

<h4>No Grade Submitted</h4>

<p>The grade of Y is issued to all students in a course whose instructor failed to meet
the grade reporting deadline at the end of the term. This grade will not be issued to any
student in a course if other students in the same course were awarded grades by the
instructor. </p>

<p><b>Averaging of Grades</b><font color="#FF0000"><br>
(Policy updated 1/10/06)<i><br>
Wording change to clarify calculation of cumulative GPA</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the purpose of computing grade-point averages, grade points are assigned 
to each grade as follows: A, 4 points for each semester unit; B, 3 points; C, 2 
points; D, 1 point; and E, 0 points. The grade-point-average is the arithmetic mean of the grade points earned for 
all credits taken at the University of Arizona for
<a href="../../2005-06/policies/definiti.htm#ucredit">
University Credit</a> or by
<a href="../../2005-06/policies/profexem.htm#specialexam">
Special Examination for Grade</a>, where regular grades are awarded. Ordinarily 
cumulative GPAs are calculated using only the courses at the career level of the 
student. For example, the undergraduate GPA is based on undergraduate courses 
only (see <a href="../../2005-06/policies/enrpol.htm#gradcreditseniors">Graduate 
Credit for Seniors</a>,
<a href="../../2005-06/policies/gro2.htm">Grade Replacement 
Opportunity</a>, and
<a href="../../2005-06/policies/acadrenw.htm">Academic 
Renewal for exceptions</a>). </p>

<p><b>Change of Grade</b> </p>

<p>Within one (1) year of the awarding of the grade, final grades may be changed by the
instructor on a change-of-grade form, only if there has been an error in computation . The
grade change must be approved by the head of the instructor's department. </p>

<p><b>Academic Renewal</b> </p>

<p>Under certain circumstances an undergraduate student may apply to the Registrar's
office for academic renewal. Academic renewal allows students to have grades for a
particular period of time excluded from the grade-point average. If the qualifications are
met, the student may have a maximum of four consecutive semesters of course work
disregarded in all calculations regarding academic standing, grade-point average, and
eligibility for graduation. If summer work is to be included in the work to be
disregarded, a five-week summer term shall count as one-half semester. </p>

<p>To qualify for academic renewal, the following conditions must be met: 

<ul>
  <li>At the time the request is filed, a minimum of five years shall have elapsed since the
    most recent course work to be disregarded was completed. </li>
  <li>In the interval between the completion of the most recent course work to be disregarded
    and the filing of the request, the student shall have completed a minimum of 30 units of
    regularly graded course work at the University with a minimum grade-point average of 2.500
    on all work completed at the University in that interval. </li>
  <li>If more than one semester or term is to be disregarded, these shall be consecutive,
    completed within a maximum of two calendar years, and with no intervening enrollments at
    the University. The maximum of two calendar years may be extended by one semester if the
    time period includes a semester of involuntary absence by reason of disqualification. </li>
</ul>

<p>If the student satisfies the conditions under this policy, the office of the Registrar
will annotate the student's permanent academic record to indicate that no work taken
during the disregarded semester(s) or term(s), even if satisfactory, may apply toward
graduation. However, all work will remain on the record, ensuring a true and accurate
academic history. </p>

<p>Academic renewal may be effected only once during a student's undergraduate academic
career and is not available to students who have completed requirements for a bachelor's
degree. </p>
