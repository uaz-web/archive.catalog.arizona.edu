<h4>Upper-Division Writing Proficiency Examination (UDWPE)</h4>

<p>Every student must take the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination, which is a
prerequisite to enrolling in a writing-emphasis course (see below). Students may take the
exam after they have satisfied the first-year composition requirement and accumulated at
least 40 but less than 75 credit hours toward their degree. Students who have accumulated
more than 75 credit hours should take the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination
as soon as possible. Students register for the exam with the University Composition Board
(Modern Languages 380). </p>

<p>The examination may be taken only once. Results are reported to students and to their
major departments. Students who earn an evaluation of unsatisfactory on the exam usually
are required by their department to complete further developmental work in writing before
registering for writing-emphasis courses. They should consult with their academic advisors
for specific information about their department's requirements. </p>

<h4>Writing Emphasis Course</h4>

<p>Every undergraduate degree program includes at least one required writing-emphasis
course. Writing-emphasis courses are regular junior- or senior-level courses in an
academic discipline in which at least half the grade awarded is determined by written work
appropriate to the academic discipline. Such courses are identified with the phrase
&quot;Writing-Emphasis Course&quot; at the end of the course description listed in the
catalog. Prerequisite to a writing-emphasis course is a satisfactory performance on the
UDWPE or, for those students whose UDWPE is evaluated as unsatisfactory, further
developmental work in writing as defined above. </p>
