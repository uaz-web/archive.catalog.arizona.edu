<p>General education programs provide breadth of knowledge as a balance and complement to
the depth provided by the major. General education is designed to accomplish several
goals: first, to afford students the opportunity to learn how different disciplines
define, acquire and organize knowledge; second, to provide a basis for an examination of
values; third, to develop analytic, synthetic, linguistic and computational skills useful
for lifelong learning; and finally, to provide a common foundation for wide-ranging
dialogue with peers on issues of significance. Taken together, the experiences of general
education encourage the student to develop a critical and inquiring attitude, an
appreciation of complexity and ambiguity, a tolerance for and empathy with persons of
different backgrounds or values and a deepened sense of self. In short, the goal of the
general education program is to prepare students to respond more fully and effectively to
an increasingly complex world. </p>

<p>The general education program at The University of Arizona is university-wide; that is,
regardless of college or major, students hold their general education requirements in
common. The following table presents the program in schematic form.</p>

<h3><a name="Foundations"><strong>Foundations</strong></a></h3>

<p>This component builds a foundation in certain skills that can be further developed in
major courses and in Tier 1 and Tier 2 general education courses. Foundations include a
course in mathematics (the character of which will vary with the major), courses in
composition, fourth-semester skill level in a second language for all students in B.A.
degree programs, and second-semester skill level in a second language for all students in
non-B.A. degree programs. (Students in engineering will satisfy the second language
requirement by taking the placement examination at entrance to the University.)</p>

<p>Each segment of this component may be satisfied, at least in part, by demonstration of
proficiency as well as by course work. </p>

<p><a name="Mathematics"><b>Mathematics Requirements
</b></a></p>

<p><font size="3" color="#9C0800">(Policy updated on June 1, 2001:&nbsp; PHIL
110 added to list of courses that require the MRT)</font></p>

<p>Collegiate Algebra (MATH 121), or any three-unit mathematics course numbered above 121
is required of all students. The Math Readiness Test is required of all students prior to
enrolling in any math course numbered below MATH 125b and PHIL 110. Test scores are valid for one year.</p>

<p>Entry-level mathematics students should choose one of three strands according to their
interests, preparation, and intended major. All strands presume that students will have
completed the high school math required for entry to the University.</p>

<p>The three strands are: </p>

<p><strong>G (General Knowledge)</strong> —This strand involves a general 
understanding and appreciation of how mathematics is used to solve problems in 
everyday life; for example, the mathematics of voting and elections, or of 
networks and paths. The G-strand does not prepare a student for any further 
mathematically-based work: it is a terminal course. Only those students whose 
major requires the most general knowledge of mathematics would take this strand. 
The options for this strand are MATH 122 (Mathematics in Modern Society) and 
PHIL 110 (Logic and Critical Thinking). To satisfy the mathematics requirement 
G-Strand, students must attain a certain minimum score on the MRT.&nbsp; Each of 
thee courses requires a different score (see the chart provided on the
<a href="http://www.math.arizona.edu/placement">Math Placement Homepage</a>).</p>

<p><strong>M (Moderate Knowledge)</strong> &#151;The M-strand is for students who require
mathematical facility at the level of at least MATH 121 (Collegiate Algebra). This strand
involves reasonable facility with algebra and algebraic functions, graphs, and simple
modeling. Students who choose the M-strand are prepared for further mathematical work.
This work may include MATH 119 (Finite Mathematics), MATH 123 (Elements of Calculus), or a
statistics class from outside the mathematics department. </p>

<p><strong>S (Substantial Knowledge)</strong> &#151;This strand involves skill and
facility with calculus. The S-strand begins at one of two calculus options - MATH 124
(Calculus with Applications) or MATH 125a (Calculus). Students who successfully complete
the S-strand may continue on to MATH 125b, 223, or beyond. Those who choose but are not
ready to begin the S-strand will be required to take preparatory work.</p>

<p>Each major indicates the mathematics strand that is most appropriate for its students.
It is important to note that each strand provides a different level of mathematical
training, but students can satisfy the mathematics requirement in their major by
completing a more advanced mathematics course. Because the S-strand presumes the M- strand
and the M-strand presumes the G-strand, students will have the most flexibility in their
major choice by aiming for the S-strand. A student who chooses to meet the general
education mathematics requirement with the G-strand will have the most restricted set of
major choices. </p>

<h3><a name="Tier_One">Tier One and Tier Two </a></h3>

<p>Both Tier One and Tier Two courses offer rigorous treatments of fundamental knowledge
and methods of inquiry. They are designed to foster independent, creative, and interactive
learning, inspiring students to think about themselves, others, and social organizations
in new and insightful ways. Students are exposed to various areas of study and acquire
valuable skills and knowledge applicable to their lives at the University and beyond. See <a href="../../faculty/courses/984/gened.html">General Education Courses</a> for approved courses and
descriptions. </p>

<h3>Tier One</h3>

<p>Tier One courses introduce new students to fundamental issues and concepts pertinent to
three study areas: Traditions and Cultures, Individuals and Societies, and Natural
Sciences. Students are required to take two courses in each segment of Tier One, for a
total of six courses. Students entering the University as freshmen will be expected to
complete Tier One requirements by the end of the midpoint of their degree (e.g. for a
four-year 120-unit degree program by the end of the second year of full-time work or the
completion of 60 units). </p>
