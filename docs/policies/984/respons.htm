<p align="center"><big><strong>Student Responsibility and Degree Requirements</strong></big></p>

<p>The university, its colleges, and departments establish certain academic requirements
which must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as
curricula and courses, majors and minors, and campus residence. Advisors, faculty,
directors, department heads, and deans are available to help the student understand and
arrange to meet these requirements, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them. </p>

<p>At the end of the student's course of study, if requirements for graduation have not
been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. It is important for each student to be
acquainted with his/her <a href="catchoice.htm">chosen catalog</a> and to be
responsible for completing requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Announcements in the catalog concerning
regulations, fees, curricula, or other matters are subject to change without notice.
Courses, programs, and requirements described in the catalog may be suspended,
deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed in any manner at any time at the
sole discretion of the University of Arizona and the Arizona Board of Regents.
The catalog does not establish a contractual relationship, but it summarizes the
total requirements which the student must presently meet before qualifying for a
faculty recommendation to the Arizona Board of Regents to award a degree. For
this reason, students must remain currently informed about all policies and other
information that bears directly on completing a degree program.</p>

<p>The electronic catalog is the official general catalog of The University of Arizona.
Students may access the catalog from any computer connected to the Internet. A complete
printed version of the electronic catalog is also available in The University of Arizona
Main Library, and in the Office of the Registrar. </p>

<p><i>The Academic Manual</i>, available in the ASUA Bookstore, provides information
excerpted from the electronic catalog. The manual is meant as a guide to the electronic
catalog; it does not contain all information that is available electronically. On many
subjects, more detailed information is available from the catalog, from <b><i>On Course!</i></b>
<b>Academic Program Requirements Reports</b>  (APRRs), and from departments, colleges, or administrative units responsible for various
programs and services. Students should seek information from these sources as needed. </p>
