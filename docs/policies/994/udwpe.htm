(UDWPE)</small></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Every student must take the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination,
  which is a prerequisite to enrolling in a writing-emphasis course (see below).
  Students may take the exam after they have satisfied the first-year
  composition requirement and accumulated at least 40 but less than 75 credit
  hours toward their degree. Students who have accumulated more than 75 credit
  hours should take the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination as soon
  as possible. Students register for the exam with the University Composition
  Board (Modern Languages 380).</p>
  <p>The examination may be taken only once. Results are reported to students
  and to their major departments. Students who earn an evaluation of
  unsatisfactory on the exam usually are required by their department to
  complete further developmental work in writing before registering for
  writing-emphasis courses. They should consult with their academic advisors for
  specific information about their department's requirements.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font size="3">Writing Emphasis Course</font></strong></p>
  <p>Every undergraduate degree program includes at least one required
  writing-emphasis course. Writing-emphasis courses are regular junior- or
  senior-level courses in an academic discipline in which at least half the
  grade awarded is determined by written work appropriate to the academic
  discipline. Such courses are identified with the phrase &quot;Writing-Emphasis
  Course&quot; at the end of the course description listed in the Catalog.
  Prerequisite to a writing-emphasis course is a satisfactory performance on the
  UDWPE or, for those students whose UDWPE is evaluated as unsatisfactory,
  further developmental work in writing as defined above.</p>
