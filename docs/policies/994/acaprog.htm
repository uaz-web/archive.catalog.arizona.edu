  <p>Good standing status denotes that a student is eligible to continue in or

  <h3><small><b>Academic Progress</b></small></h3>
  <p>Undergraduate students will be considered to be making normal progress
  toward a degree if their cumulative grade-point average for all work attempted

  <h3><b><small>Minimum Grade-Point-Average Required for Continued Enrollment</small></b></h3>
  <p>One of the requirements for students to be eligible to continue at the
  University is that they earn minimum cumulative averages as follows:</p>

	<h3><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Freshmen who have completed fewer than 14 units at the University with a
  University of Arizona cumulative grade-point average between 1.750 and 2.000,
  or who have completed from 14 through 26 units at the University with a
  University of Arizona cumulative grade-point average of between 1.840 and
  2.000 will be on academic warning status. Academic warning status invokes no
  academic penalties and will not be indicated on the student's permanent
  record. This status serves as a warning to students beginning their college
  careers that their performance is below the level required for successful
  completion of an academic program. Students in this status are strongly urged
  to seek academic counseling.</font></span></h3>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: 400"><b><small>Probation, Academic</small></b></span></h3>
  <p>Students not meeting the standards of normal progress or academic warning
  status will be on academic probation. Students on academic probation are
  subject to such restrictions with respect to courses and extracurricular
  activities as may be imposed by the academic dean of the college in which the
  student is enrolled. Students are removed from probation upon earning the
  minimum cumulative grade-point average required by the table listed under
  &quot;Minimum Grade-Point Average Required&quot; above.</p>
  <p>(See the Dean of Student's, <font size="3"><img src="../../images/images1999/unofficial-sm.gif" width="15" height="16">

  information.)</p>
  <h3><small><b>Disqualification</b></small></h3>
  <p>Disqualification is of two types: from a particular college in the
  University or from the University. A student may be academically disqualified
  only after two consecutive regular semesters of not meeting the standards of
  normal progress (cumulative grade-point average of 2.0) or academic warning
  status; or under conditions described below under &quot;Probation or
  Disqualification by Special Action&quot;.</p>
  <p>The student recommended for disqualification from a particular college may
  seek immediate admission to another college in the University. Permission for
  admission to another college must be obtained in writing from the dean of the
  college into which the student plans to transfer. The letter of permission
  should be presented to the Office of the Registrar. Ordinarily permission will
  be granted only if the student plans to pursue a modified program in a
  curriculum of the new college and has demonstrated ability warranting such
  action. Those who have been given college disqualification are strongly urged
  to seek thorough academic and vocational counseling and guidance. Failure to
  secure approval to transfer to another college in the University is tantamount
  to university disqualification and the rules governing this type of
  disqualification then will apply. A disqualified student may not attend the
  University as a non-degree student.</p>
  <p>A student disqualified from a particular college who may have secured
  subsequent permission to register in another college is automatically on
  academic probation in the new college. A student may be granted college
  disqualification only once in his or her academic career. Any later
  disqualification will be considered a university disqualification.</p>
  <h3><small><b>University Disqualification</b></small></h3>
  <p>A student who receives university disqualification is restricted from
  registering at The University of Arizona and may return to the University only
  on the basis of evidence that underlying conditions have materially improved
  and that he or she is now capable of academic success. Students seeking
  readmission who left the University on academic probation or under
  disqualification must receive approval from the dean of the college they wish
  to enter prior to readmission.</p>
  <h3><small><b>Probation or Disqualification by Special Action</b></small></h3>
  <p>Upon recommendation of the dean of the college, a student may be placed on
  academic probation or may be disqualified at any time for neglect of academic
  work.</p>
  <h3><small><b>Credit Restrictions for Students under University
  Disqualification</b></small></h3>
	<p><font color="#FF0000">(Policy revised 9/11/06.&nbsp; As of Fall 2006, there is 
	no reference to correspondence enrollment.&nbsp; Students in all catalogs are 
	subject to the Academic Disqualification policy stated in the 2006-07 
	Catalog:&nbsp; <a href="../../2006-07/policies/acaprog.htm#University ">
	http://catalog.arizona.edu/2006-07/policies/acaprog.htm#University%20Disqualification)</a></font></p>
  <p>Students who are under disqualification from the University may not take
  University of Arizona courses for credit or establish credit by examination
  during their periods of disqualification, although they may remove incomplete
  grades. With the permission of the college dean concerned, students who have
  been disqualified from the University may register for correspondence
  enrollment.</p>
