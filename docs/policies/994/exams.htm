<blockquote>
  <h3><small>Mid-Semester Examinations</small></h3>
  <p>It is expected that all mid-semester examinations will occur during a
  regularly scheduled class period of the course. For those multiple-section
  courses in which it is impossible to offer mid-semester examinations during
  the regular class period, the following requirements for offering the
  examination at an alternate time must be met: (1) the course shall be
  identified in the schedule of classes as requiring combined hourly
  examinations at a time different from the regular class period; (2) the times
  at which combined hourly examinations will be given shall be listed in the
  schedule of classes; (3) the controlling academic dean shall approve such
  action in advance; and (4) students whose schedules conflict with the time
  scheduled for the combined examination shall be provided an alternate time for
  taking the examination.</p>
  <h3><small>Final Examinations</small></h3>
  <p>All courses offered for credit shall include a final examination given at
  the regularly scheduled examination time. No deviation from the exam schedule,
  once it is printed, is authorized. All forms of examinations (quizzes,
  take-homes, etc.) are prohibited on any scheduled class day during the week in
  which regularly scheduled final exams begin. Specific exceptions for certain
  courses may be granted by obtaining prior approval from the appropriate
  department and academic dean. Students shall be informed of any such
  exceptions prior to the end of the fourth week of classes.</p>
