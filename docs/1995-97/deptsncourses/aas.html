The objectives of the African American Studies Program are to
provide students with opportunities to learn about the African
heritage in the Americas. Its curriculum is designed 1) to explore
past and present cultural, political, and economic links between
Africa and African descent populations in the Americas, and 2)
to provide a comparative interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological
examination of issues shaping the lives of persons of African
descent in the United States and other nations of the Americas.
The program seeks to accomplish these goals by 1) identifying
courses offered in other departments and programs which focus
on Africa or populations of African descent in the Americas, and
2) providing a minor in African American studies which provides
different perspectives from which to examine issues to which students
are exposed. African American studies courses are intended to
supplement disciplinary offering as well as provide students with
perspectives from within and across disciplines which challenge
and question their established theories, methods, and conclusions.
<P>
For the minor in African American studies, students are required
to successfully complete twenty-two (22) credit hours of courses.
Ten (10) credit hours must be taken in Area I and the remaining
twelve (12) can be taken in any <I>one</I>, not a combination,
of the other four study areas. Cross-listed offerings acceptable
for the African American studies requirement are included in the
appropriate study area described below. (Note: these acceptable
cross-listed courses may change. Students should seek advice from
the African American studies advisor to determine whether a course
is acceptable.)
<P>
<I>Study Area I: African American studies theory and methodology:</I>
examines the past and present research agenda of African American
studies. Courses in this area address the development of the field
in relation to changes in issues of concern to African descent
populations in the Americas. Courses in this area examine problems
in the institutionalization of African American studies, the interdisciplinary
nature of its methodology and theory; and exploration of disciplines,
scholars, and historical events which have influenced the foci
of its past and contemporary research agenda-ten (10) credits.

<I>Study Area II: African American literature, literary criticism
and drama:</I> examines historical developments and contemporary
variations in the literary and performing arts of African descent
populations in Africa and the Americas. Courses in this area attend
to the sociopolitical and economic context of artistic productions
with special attention to the implications such contexts have
for general literary and symbolic theories-twelve (12) credit
hours, at least three (3) of which should be devoted to a course
that explores the influence of gender on variations in artistic
productions.

and economy:</I> examines the form, function and implications
of underlying processes in the historical formation of contemporary
demographic, economic, and political patterns that characterize
African descent populations in the Americas in comparison with
those of the African continent-twelve (12) credit hours, at least
three (3) of which should be devoted to a course that is primarily
focused on Africa, and three (3) to one that directs attention
to an African descent population outside of the United States
but in the Americas.

examines processes of cultural production, institution building,

populations in the Americas and on the African continent. Courses
in this area examine past and current theories of culture formation,
personality development, stages of moral development, and sociopolitical
integration with special attention to their comparative implications
among Americans of African descent within and across the categorical
distinctions generally referred to as &quot;racial groups,&quot;
and &quot;class strata&quot;-12 credit hours.
