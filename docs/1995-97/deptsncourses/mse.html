<P>
Materials science is the science of the structure, properties
and behavior of metals, semiconductors, ceramics, polymers, and
composite materials. The materials scientist strives to expand
knowledge of the properties of existing materials and to develop
new materials.
<P>
Materials engineering emphasizes the fundamental knowledge necessary
to select, process, and apply materials for societal needs. The
materials engineer strives to transform materials for practical
use.
<P>
More than one-fourth of all scientists and engineers are involved
in the science or engineering of materials, indicating that almost
every field in science and engineering uses materials. Recognizing
the importance of materials in nearly every aspect of technology,
the University of Arizona has committed its resources to expanding
the Department of MSE. A wide range of courses, covering the many
facets of MSE, is now offered at both the undergraduate and graduate
levels.
<P>
The department offers the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Materials
Science and Engineering, Master of Science with a major in materials
science and engineering, and Doctor of Philosophy with a major
in materials science and engineering.
