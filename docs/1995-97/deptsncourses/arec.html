The department's program is designed to relate agricultural and
resource problems and issues in contemporary society to their
underlying economic explanations. Through the choice of elective
courses the major in agricultural and resource economics may build
programs in: agricultural business to prepare for careers in the
management of farms, ranches and agribusiness firms; economic
development for careers in rural area development and foreign
agricultural development; resource and environmental economics
for careers in the management of public resources of land and
water; and preparation for graduate study for careers in business,
teaching and research.
<P>
The following degrees are offered: Bachelor of Science in Agriculture
with a major in agricultural and resource economics and Master
of Science with a major in agricultural and resource economics.
The Doctor of Philosophy degree with a major in economics and
an emphasis in agricultural and resource economics is administered
by the combined faculties of the departments of Economics and
Agricultural and Resource Economics.
<P>
<I>The major: </I>Undergraduate majors must complete the general
education requirements as described in the College of Agriculture
section of the catalog. Courses in four of the five required study
areas must be selected from a departmentally approved list. Included
in this list are MATH 119 and 123 or 124, ECON 201a, 201b, 330
or 332 and AREC 242. Additional requirements include ACCT 200,
either ECON 300 or 361, and a minimum of 21 units in upper-division
agricultural and resource economics courses. The major in agricultural
and resource economics assumes a moderate to substantial knowledge
of mathematics. Majors must choose additional coursework from
options in either Agricultural Economics, Agribusiness Management,
or Resource and Environmental Economics.
<P>
Agricultural Economics Option: This option is designed for the
student interested in the application of economics to societal
problems. AREC 339, 403, 404 and 464 are required. Forty-one units
of elective credit are open to the student.
<P>
Agribusiness Management Option: Designed for the student interested
in the management of agricultural production, marketing/sales
and service business. In addition to the above general requirements,
ACCT 210, 310 and MAP 330 are required. Students taking this option
must also complete AREC 213, 215, 339, 403, 404, 450 and 464.
Majors in this option are encouraged to enroll in additional relevant
courses in the College of Business and Public Administration.
<P>
Enrollment in 300- and 400-level BPA courses is restricted by
the BPA College to those who apply for and attain Advanced Standing.
Apply in McClelland Hall 103; call 621-2505 for information.
<P>
Resource and Environmental Economics Option: This option meets
the needs of the student interested in the economic analysis of
environmental and natural resource issues facing society. In addition
to the general requirements, AREC 217, 339, 350, 375, 403, 404,
464, and 476 are required. Students are encouraged to use 44 elective
units in courses relating to biology, political science and natural
resource management.
<P>
<I>The minor:</I> A minimum of 20 units of course work is required
in agricultural economics. At least 9 units must be selected from
ACCT 200, AREC 213, 215, 217 and ECON 300, 330 or 361. A minimum
of 12 upper-division units must be selected from a list of concentration
courses that can be obtained from a minor advisor. Students are
expected to have prerequisites and/or supporting courses that
may be required for the courses in the minor.
