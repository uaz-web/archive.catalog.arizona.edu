<P>
The science of anthropology is the study of human beings, their
origins, thought, and behavior. The Department of Anthropology
offers graduate and undergraduate course work in four sub-disciplines:
archaeology, biological an-thropology, cultural anthropology and
linguistic anthropology, as well as spe- cialized training for
field research. Special internships and independent studies in
museology are available through the Arizona State Museum. The
Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology is a center for applied
anthropological research in the American Southwest and similar
multicultural and ecological settings elsewhere in the world.
The department cooperates with the Arizona Health Sciences Center
in offering a program in medical anthropology.
<P>
The degrees offered by the department are the Bachelor of Arts,
Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy with a major in anthropology.
<P>
<I>The major </I>for the B.A. requires a minimum of 36 units of
anthropology, 18 of which must be in upper-division courses. All
majors must take 101, 102, 200, 235, 265 and 276, which provide
the student with basic training in all four subdisciplines. The
student may then select one of three programs: (1) a general program
that requires one upper-division course in each of the four subdisciplines
plus two additional upper-division courses (a minimum of six courses);
(2) a special program which requires three upper-division courses
in each of two subdisciplines (a minimum of six courses); or (3)
a topical or areal specialization approved by the undergraduate
advisor (a minimum of six upper-division courses). All majors
are required to take MATH 117 (College Algebra). For those students
concentrating in biological anthropology, an additional course
from MATH 123, 124, 125a or 125b is recommended.
<P>
<I>The supporting minor</I> may be chosen from any department
or program within the University.
<P>
The department participates in the Honors Program.
