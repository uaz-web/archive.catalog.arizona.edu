<P>
The Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences prepares students
for careers in basic and clinical sciences (speech-language pathology,
audiology, speech science, and hearing science) in university,
laboratory, medical, public school, or other clinical settings.
Professional certification in the state of Arizona and with the
American Speech-Language-Hearing Association requires graduate
study with the acquisition of a Master of Science degree.
<P>
The department offers the following degrees: Bachelor of Science
in Speech and Hearing Sciences, Master of Science and Doctor of
Philosophy with a major in speech and hearing sciences. For graduate
admission and degree requirements, consult the <I>Graduate Catalog</I>.
<P>
<I>The major</I>: The major requires 30 units, including 260,
280, 350, 367, 370, 371, 451, 483 and 496a.
<P>
In addition to the general education requirements for the B.S.
degree as described in Arts and Sciences section of this catalog,
the department requires one course in mathematics or statistics
beyond college algebra and 8 hours in a laboratory science course
beyond the minimum requirement. Coursework in human anatomy and
physiology with a laboratory are required. Required courses include
EXSS 201 and 202, or their equivalent. A 20-unit minor is also
required. Students enrolled in the American Indian Professional
Training program should consult with their advisors re-garding
the mathematics and science requirements. At least 24 units in
the major must be University Credit. Minimum total units for the
degree with this major-125.
