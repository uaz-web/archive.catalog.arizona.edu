Sociology is the study of human society, its origins, functions
and problems. It focuses on relations among people, groups, organizations,
classes and cultures. Sociology explores and analyzes issues vital
to our personal lives, our communities, our nation, the world.
The curriculum in sociology is designed to show students the social
character of human life and the impact of varying forms of social
organization on human affairs. Students are introduced to the
methods by which knowledge is obtained, and may examine the results
of research on such diverse topics as the family, religion, education,
politics and crime.
<P>
The major provides a foundation for careers in many professional
fields, such as law, criminal justice and social service, and
for graduate training as a professional sociologist in government,
bus-iness, community agencies, research organizations or educational
institutions. Undergraduates are encouraged to become actively
involved in the design of their education, and to take advantage
of the opportunities and services offered by the department. Most
of these services are available through the department's Office
of Undergraduate Services located in Social Sciences, Room 437.
The office is open five days a week and administers a wide range
of programs for undergraduate majors. These programs include:
(1) a comprehensive advising system designed to aid students in
choosing a major, planning a course of study and in designing
and pursuing a post-graduate career plan; (2) an internship program
designed to give eligible majors course credit for work experience
in a variety of community agencies; (3) a Majors Club designed
to better integrate our majors into the intellectual and social
life of the department. More information on these and other services
can be obtained by visiting the office or by reading the relevant
sections in the department's <I>Handbook for Sociology Majors</I>,
available in the Undergraduate Office.
<P>
<I>The major for the B.A</I>. requires a minimum of 36 units of
sociology, 21 of which must be upper-division courses. All majors
must take 101, 274, 275 and 300, which provide students with a
theoretical overview of the discipline and the fundamentals of
its research methods and statistics. The major assumes moderate
knowledge of mathematics. Students must complete MATH 117 or a
higher level course. (Majors are strongly advised to take 101,
274 and 275 before the start of their junior year.) In addition,
all majors are required to take one course in each of the three
&quot;focal areas&quot; that make up the undergraduate curriculum.
These three areas, with appropriate course listings, are as follows:
(1) organizations and institutions: 315, 317, 321, 322, 326, 422;
(2) social inequality: 150, 160, 161, 313, 450, 459, 467; (3)
social issues and problems: 189, 201, 324, 341, 342, 343, 344,
441, 442. Following completion of the required courses, qualified
majors will be eligible for the &quot;Advanced Track&quot; within
the major. The &quot;Advanced Track&quot; consists of two highly
specialized courses tailored to the interests and career goals
of the major. The first of these courses, Practicum in Sociology
(394), will consist of an intensive practicum experience designed
to give the student the opportunity to apply or practice sociology
in a work or research setting. The other course, Senior Capstone
in So-ciology (488x), will provide students with an intensive
classroom experience designed to give them the opportunity to
integrate and assimilate what they have learned through their
course work in the major. To qualify for the &quot;Advanced Track,&quot;
majors must satisfy three requirements. They must have (1) completed
21 units of coursework in the major; (2) achieved a minimum grade
point average of 3.00 in the major; and (3) attained senior standing
at The University by completing a minimum of 87 units. Majors
not satisfying these requirements will be ineligible for the &quot;Advanced
Track.&quot; Instead, they will complete the &quot;Standard Track&quot;
within the major by taking an additional 15 elective units of
sociology coursework. All majors may include up to 6 units of
393, 394 and 399 among their elective units. (Upper-division courses
require completion of 56 units or consent of the instructor. Otherwise,
unless specifically indicated, sociology courses do not have prerequisites.)
The Writing-Emphasis course is 300 (for prerequisites, see course
listing). Students wishing to become a major are required to discuss
their general interests, academic plans and the suitability of
the major for their intellectual and career development. Appointments
with faculty advisors should be scheduled through the Office of
Undergraduate Studies.
<P>
<I>The supporting minor</I> for sociology majors is chosen by
the student in consultation with an advisor.
<P>
<I>The minor</I> in sociology for nonmajors consists of 20 units,
12 of which must be upper-division.
<P>
<I>The teaching mino</I>r: 21 units, including 101 and 300.
<P>
