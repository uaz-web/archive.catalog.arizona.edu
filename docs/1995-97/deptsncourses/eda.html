The department offers programs leading to the Master of Arts and
Doctor of Philosophy degrees with a major in higher education
and the Doctor of Education degree with a major in educational
administration. At the time of catalog production, the Doctor
of Education with a major in educational administration was under
revision. The Education Specialist degree with a major in educational
administration and the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy
with a major in foundations of education were under review at
the time of the catalog production. Consult the department head
for current information.
<P>
Concentrations are available within graduate majors offered in
the department. The major in higher education is offered through
the Center for the Study of Higher Education, with concentrations
in academic administration, student personnel services administration,
finance and business affairs administration, community college
administration, curriculum and instruction, higher education policy
making, and institutional research and planning.
<P>
The department also offers certification in educational administration.
Students seeking institutional recommendation for Arizona administrative
certification should major in educational administration. In the
Center for the Study of Higher Education, master's degree programs
may be designed to meet the requirements for the Arizona Community
College Teaching Certificate (Type A1a) or for entry-level administrative
service in institutions of higher education.
<P>
An undergraduate grade-point average of at least 3.00 is required
for admission to full standing in a graduate degree program. However,
applicants with undergraduate grade-point averages of 2.50 to
2.99 may be admitted on a provisional basis. Standardized test
scores also are required (e.g., GRE, Millers Analogies). Beyond
these minimal requirements, applicants must also meet the specific
requirements for all majors offered in the department. The meeting
of standards does not guarantee admission.
