<P>
The departments of biochemistry, ecology and evolutionary biology,
and mo-lecular and cellular biology offer a program leading to
a Master of Science degree with a major in general biology. This
program is designed for middle and high school biology teachers
who desire advanced, specialized training in the biological sciences
to enhance their classroom teaching methods.
<P>
The Master of Science in General Biology degree is a summer-oriented,
32-unit program of course work and research units. The curriculum
consists of: Biology Update I (BIOC 623a), Biology Update II (BIOC623b),
Secondary Biology Laboratory Curricula (BIOC 633), Biology Lesson
Development (BIOC 643) and electives, independent study, research,
preceptorship and thesis units.
<P>
Participants take 6 units of graduate electives in the biological
sciences and an additional 3 units in any approved science, math
or education course. A maximum of 3 units of BIOC 597a may be
used to fulfill the elective requirements. Six units of research
are required, 4 of which must be in a biology field; the other
2 units may be in biology, science education or science issues.

<P>
Participants take 3 units of independent study: 1 unit to follow
up on course work resulting from BIOC 633; 1 unit to prepare for
research units; 1 unit for the purpose of field testing lessons
developed through research and BIOC 643.
<P>
A 1-unit preceptorship to disseminate scientific knowledge, curriculum
materials and teaching approaches among the participants' peers
is required, along with a written thesis, oral presentation and
a final oral examination over the thesis.
<P>
For course descriptions, see <I>Biochemistry</I> <I>(BIOC)</I>
course listings in the <I>Departments and Courses of Instruction</I>
section of this catalog.
<P>
Applicants are required to submit a completed program application
(available in the Master's in General Biology Program office located
in the Department of Biochemistry) and official transcripts of
all college work. Call the program office at 621-5903 for application
due date. Applicants must have a minimum of one year's classroom
teaching experience at the high school or middle school level.
In addition, applicants must have completed a minimum of 18 units
of college-level biological science courses with a grade-point
average of 3.0 or better. Applicants without this background may
be required to complete additional undergraduate course work.
