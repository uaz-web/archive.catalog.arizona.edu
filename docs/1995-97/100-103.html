<B>COLLEGE OF LAW</B>
<P>
<B><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</B>
<P>
The University of Arizona College of Law is a member of the Association
of American Law Schools and an approved law school of the American
Bar Association. A rigorous course of professional education prepares
students for service to the community in the private and public
practice of law. To qualify for membership in the legal profession,
a student must possess a broad educational experience and significant
intellectual capacity, and must successfully negotiate a difficult
course of study during which he or she is expected to master the
principles of the law and of the legal system and to acquire professional
techniques of lawyers.
<P>
To obtain application forms and additional information including
a <I>College of Law Catalog,</I> send a postcard to: The Admissions
Office, College of Law, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona
85721.
<P>
<B><A NAME="adm"></A>Admission</B> 
<P>
Admission to the College of Law is very competitive. The College
seeks to enroll a class of approximately 150 students reflecting
diverse talents and experiences each fall. For the Fall 1994 entering
class, 2,444 candidates applied for admission, 399 candidates
were admitted and 151 students enrolled. The median LSAT for the
1994 first-year class was a 162 (approximately the 89th percentile)
and the median undergraduate grade-point average was 3.34. Applicants
for admission to the College of Law must have earned a bachelor's
degree from an accredited college or university. The College of
Law does not favor particular undergraduate majors or institutions.
Instead, applicants are urged to pursue a rigorous educational
experience in a diverse, balanced curriculum, to read extensively
and to develop strong analytical and writing skills. Admission
is based on the applicant's prior academic achievement, aptitude
for the study of law as indicated by the score on the Law School
Admission Test (LSAT), personal statement and references.
<P>
<B>Admission Process</B> 
<P>
Applicants are initially evaluated according to personal statements,
references and a formula that combines the candidate's undergraduate
grade-point average and score on the LSAT. Many admittees are
selected from the pool of applicants based primarily upon the
quality of their undergraduate academic performance and LSAT scores.
<P>
The balance of the entering class will be chosen by the evaluation
of the Admissions Committee from a group of exceptional candidates
whose backgrounds and academic records demonstrate achievement,
and who promise to make a significant contribution to the legal
educational process, the legal profession and the community. We
believe that diverse experiences, ideas and goals are essential
to a vital educational process and a dynamic legal profession.
In addition to academic records and test scores, the Committee
looks to other factors in the assessment of applicants, including
colleges or universities attended, course of study, grade trends,
graduate study, significant or extracurricular activities, unique
educational or occupational experiences, involvement in community
affairs, substantial community service, race and ethnicity, economic
or cultural background, participation in pre-law school programs
(e.g., CLEO) and any other factors that may justifiably be relied
upon in appraising the qualifications of applicants for success
in law school and contribution to the legal profession. In making
the selections, the Committee considers the individual strengths
and characteristics of each applicant and the entire file submitted
by each applicant in the context of the applicant pool for each
year.
<P>
<B>Application Procedure</B> 
<P>
First-year students are admitted only for the Fall semester. Under
very special circumstances, offers of admission can be deferred
one year at the discretion of the Assistant Dean for Admissions.
Applicants are encouraged to submit their applications after Oct.
1 of the year prior to anticipated enrollment.
<P>
<I>All application materials, including the LSDAS report, must
be delivered to the Admissions Office or postmarked no later than
March 1 of the year of expected enrollment.</I> 
<P>
1. To complete an application file, a candidate for admission
must submit:
<P>
A. Application for admission.
<P>
B. Personal statement (See item 2 below).
<P>
C. Self-addressed, stamped postcards.
<P>
D. LSDAS report sent to the College directly by Law Services (See
item 4 below).
<P>
E. Domicile Affidavit.
<P>
F. Two letters of recommendation (See item 5 below).
<P>
G. A <B>nonrefundable</B> $35 application processing fee. (Only
checks or money orders payable to the University of Arizona College
of Law are acceptable.)
<P>
2. The College of Law is particularly interested in students who,
by virtue of their background and experience, will bring diverse
interests and perspectives to the student body. The principal
vehicle for describing those varied educational, life and work
experiences is through the personal statement, which is required
as part of the application. A candidate's <B>personal statement</B>
should be a typed, concise and well-drafted document of two to
three pages. It should demonstrate the candidate's writing ability
and highlight the candidate's unique characteristics and personal
qualities, including educational and work experiences, talents
and special interests, cultural and economic background, in-volvement
in community affairs and public service or any events or circumstances
that have helped shape the applicant's life or given it direction.
<P>
3. All candidates must take the <B>Law School Admission Test (LSAT)</B>,
which is given at centers in the United States several times a
year. Information about the test can be obtained by writing Law
School Admission Services (LSAS), Box 2000, Newtown, PA 18940-0998
or by contacting the nearest law school or prelaw advisor. In
order to meet the March 1 deadline for complete applications,
candidates must take the test no later than the <B>December</B>
administration of the year prior to anticipated enrollment. Scores
for the February test (of the year of anticipated enrollment)
will arrive after the deadline.
<P>
An applicant may take the LSAT more than once; however, the scores
usually will be averaged for use in the initial evaluation formula.
LSAT scores earned prior to June 1991 will not be accepted for
Fall 1995 enrollment and thereafter. If candidates have questions
about whether to re-take the LSAT, contact the Admissions Office.
<P>
4. All applicants must register for a <B>Law School Data Assembly
Service Report (LSDAS)</B>. LSDAS reports are produced only for
candidates who are registered with and have paid all fees to LSDAS.
All candidates must sign the LSDAS &quot;Authorization to Release
Education Records, Agreement to Conditions, Signature&quot; section.
Please refer to the current <I>LSAT/LSDAS Registration and Information
Book.</I> 
<P>
<B>It is important to recognize that considerable lead time is
required for the LSDAS process.<I> To ensure timely completion
of applications, we recommend that candidates register with LSDAS
and submit transcripts from each undergraduate institution attended
to LSDAS prior to January 1.</I> Students should provide to LSDAS
transcripts of any coursework completed after the initial submission
to LSDAS. It is wise to keep receipts for transcripts and LSDAS
services as evidence of compliance with deadlines.</B> 
<P>
Graduate transcripts should also be sent to LSDAS. Graduate grades
will not be analyzed on the report but the transcripts will be
attached to the back of the report.
<P>
5. The College of Law requires that applicants submit <B>two letters
of recommendation.</B> Candidates are encouraged to provide two
strong, substantive letters from undergraduate or graduate faculty
under whom they have studied or others qualified to address the
candidate's analytical abilities, writing skills, unique talents
and personal qualities. Candidates are urged to send letters in
separate sealed envelopes with their applications, to facilitate
proper filing. Letters sent directly to the College of Law should
be sent to the Assistant Dean for Admissions.
<P>
<B>Applicants Who Have Previously Applied To This Law School</B>

<P>
Applicants who have been admitted or denied in previous years
must file a <B>new application</B>, personal statement, references,
domicile affidavit, self-addressed, stamped status card and a
$35 application processing fee. Additionally, all such applicants
must again register with LSDAS and have a new LSDAS report, with
the entire undergraduate record, submitted to The University of
Arizona. Previous applicants must comply with the deadlines stated
above. Previous applicants are not required to re-take the LSAT,
provided the LSAT meets the requirements of item 3 above. However,
admission to the College of Law has become increasingly competitive
in recent years. Applicants who have been denied admission and
who choose to reapply are urged to consider retaking the LSAT,
rather than relying on a score from an unsuccessful application.
<P>
Files containing prior applications, letters of recommendation
and personal statements are retained by the Admissions Office
for two years.
<P>
<B>International Students</B> 
<P>
International students seeking admission to the College of Law
must apply as first-year students, following the steps outlined
in the section on Application Procedure, including taking the
LSAT. There are no exceptions to these requirements.
<P>
LSDAS evaluates the transcripts from very few institutions outside
the U.S. and Canada. Applicants who completed undergraduate or
graduate work at institutions not evaluated by LSDAS must provide
to the College of Law the following materials to facilitate the
evaluation of their academic records:
<P>
1. An official transcript from the undergraduate or graduate institution(s),
including final grades earned.
<P>
2. An explanation of the grading system reflected on the transcripts,
descriptions of the courses taken, the nature and format of those
courses, the number of class hours involved and any other pertinent
information.
<P>
3. A detailed, written transcript analysis by an objective agency
unaffiliated with the applicant.
<P>
4. A T.O.E.F.L. score from a test taken during the past year.
<P>
<B>Deadline Summary</B> 
<P>
<B>First-Year Applicants to J.D. Program</B> 
<P>
All application materials to the College of Law by <I>March 1</I>
of the year of expected enrollment.
<P>
LSAT: Candidates must take the test no later than <I>December</I>
of the year prior to expected enrollment.
<P>
LSDAS: Advisory deadline of <I>January 1,</I> to have all transcripts

<P>
Financial Aid Priority Processing Deadline: <I>March 1</I> of

<P>
<B>Transfer Applications</B> 
<P>
A limited number of second-year students who have done exceptional
work at other law schools may be accepted as transfer students
at The University of Arizona in either the fall or spring of their
second year. Transfer applicants will not be accepted at midyear
of the first year or for the third year. However, third-year students
may apply as visiting students.
<P>
A transfer applicant must send the following items to the Admissions
Office so that they are received no later than <B>December 1</B>,
for applications for the Spring semester, and no later than <B>July
15</B> for applications for the Fall semester:
<P>
1. A completed Application for Transfer Admission.
<P>
2. A Domicile Affidavit.
<P>
3. An official LSDAS report reflecting the <B>entire undergraduate
career</B> and the LSAT score.
<P>
4. An official law school transcript, including grades and class
rank received through the <B>final semester</B> of study.
<P>
5. A letter from the dean of the law school the applicant is currently
attending stating that the student is in good standing and eligible
to continue studies at that institution.
<P>
6. A <B>nonrefundable</B> $35 application processing fee. (Only
checks or money orders, payable to The University of Arizona College
of Law, are acceptable.)
<P>
Transfer admission is highly selective. Residents ranked below
the top quartile of their class and nonresidents ranked below
the top ten percent of their class usually will not be accepted
as transfer students. <I>Transfer admission is always contingent
upon availability of space.</I> No student who has been disqualified
or placed on probation at another law school or who has failed
to maintain at least a &quot;C&quot; average for all law work
attempted will be considered for transfer to the College of Law.
<P>
Factors considered in the transfer admission process include:
the nature of the law school attended, the quality of the candidate's
performance as a first-year law student, the nature of the applicant's
undergraduate record and LSAT score, the candidate's admissibility
as a first-year applicant, the circumstances surrounding the request
to transfer and letters of recommendation from law faculty with
whom the applicant has studied.
<P>
Transfer students will not receive credit for work done at a law
school that is not a member of the Association of American Law
Schools or approved by the American Bar Association. To qualify
for graduation, transfer students must do a minimum of three semesters
of academic work, including their final two semesters' work, comprising
at least 27 units of credit, in residence at the College of Law.
<P>
<B>Visiting Applications</B> 
<P>
A very limited number of third-year students who have done well
at other law schools and have a compelling reason to study at
The University of Arizona may be accepted as visiting students
in their third year of law study. It is the policy of the College
to only admit visiting students during their third year of law
school. As with transfer admission, visiting student status is
selective and is <I>always</I> contingent upon the availability
of space. A visiting applicant must send the following items to
the Admissions Office so they they are received no later than
<B>December 1</B>, for applications for the Spring semester, and
no later than <B>July 15</B>, for applications for the Fall semester:
<P>
1. A completed application for Visiting Admission.
<P>
2. A Domicile Affidavit.
<P>
3. An official LSDAS report reflecting the <B>entire undergraduate
career</B> and the LSAT score.
<P>
4. An official law school transcript including grades and class
rank received through the final semester of study.
<P>
5. A letter from the dean of the law school the applicant is currently
attending indicating that the student is in good standing and
eligible to continue studies at that institution. In addition,
the letter must also grant permission for the student to enroll
at The University of Arizona College of Law and must state any
conditions upon the units the student's degree-granting law school
has agreed to accept.
<P>
6. A <B>nonrefundable </B>$35 application processing fee. (Only
checks and money orders, payable to The University of Arizona
College of Law, are acceptable.)
<P>
<B><A NAME="hon"></A>Honor Code</B> 
<P>
The College of Law has a strict Honor Code that governs student
conduct. The College of Law Honor Code applies to all elements
of life at the College, including the admissions process. Omissions
of fact, misrepresentation or false statements may be the basis
of denial or revocation of an offer of admission.
<P>
<B><A NAME="cha"></A>Character and Fitness</B> 
<P>
Applicants who intend to practice law should be aware that bar
admission in all states involves consideration of a bar applicant's
character and moral fitness for the practice of law. Applicants
should acquaint themselves with the bar admission requirements
of the states in which they intend to practice.
<P>
<B><A NAME="non"></A>Nondegree Students</B> 
<P>
<I>SPECIAL STUDENTS-</I>A limited number of students without the
qualifications required of candidates for the law degree may,
at the discretion of the Dean, the Associate Dean for Academic
Affairs or other designate of the Dean, be allowed to audit a
course or a limited number of courses as Special Students. Applicants
must have experience and educational background that indicate
a strong probability that they will be successful in law study.
They must also demonstrate a special need for legal training.
The discretion of the Dean or Associate Dean to permit special
students to audit a course is limited to people within the University
community (faculty, staff, graduate students) and members of the
legal profession (lawyers and judges). If permission is granted
to anyone within these designated groups, then the auditing process
is administered by the College of Law Registrar's Office. Students
who anticipate the possibility of applying or enrolling as a full-time
student at some point in the future should not seek Special Student
status. The purpose of Special Student status is to meet a specific
educational or work-related need, not to provide a prelaw experience.
<P>
<I>STUDENTS FROM OTHER COLLEGES-</I>Graduate students participating
in a graduate degree program, with the written approval of their
advisors and Dean of the Graduate College, may register for a
limited number of courses in the College of Law. Students desiring
to do so will be required to obtain the approval of the instructor
and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the College of
Law.
<P>
Special students and students from other colleges studying at
the College of Law are not degree candidates, and are not eligible
for the bar examination in Arizona. In addition, law courses taken
as a nondegree student cannot be used as credit toward a law degree
should an individual apply, be admitted and enroll subsequently
at the College of Law.
<P>
Inquiries regarding admission should be addressed to:
