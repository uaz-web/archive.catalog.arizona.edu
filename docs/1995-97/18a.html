<B>ACADEMIC POLICIES AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS</B>

<P>
<B>SCHOLARSHIP REQUIREMENTS</B> 
<P>
<B>Minimum Grade-Point Average Required</B> 
<P>
One of the requirements for students to be eligible to continue
in the institution is that they earn minimum cumulative averages
as follows:<HR>

<P>
Total units completed Minimum grade-point average<BR>
at UA and accepted in based upon University<BR>
transfer Credit at University of<BR>
Arizona
<P>
Fewer than 14 units 1.750<BR>
From 14 through 26 units 1.840<BR>
27 or more units 2.000<BR>
Graduate students (any student registered<BR>
in the Graduate College), work carried for<BR>
graduate credit only 3.000<HR>

<P>
For scholarship requirements in the College of Law, see the Colleges
section of this catalog.
<P>
<B>Good Standing</B> 
<P>
Good standing status denotes that a student is eligible to continue
in or to return to the University.
<P>
<B>University Credit</B> 
<P>
University credit is the term used to identify all credit offered
by The University of Arizona with the exception of correspondence
credit and Special Examination for Credit. Only the grades of
courses taken for University credit and by Special Examination
for Grade are used in calculating the grade-point average.
<P>
<B>Definition of Unit of Credit</B> 
<P>
Utilizing the definition that an hour of work is the equivalent
of 50 minutes of class time (often called a contact hour) or 60
minutes of independent-study work, university policy requires
at least 45 hours of work by each student for each unit of credit.
Contact hours required for specific types of courses are as follows:
<P>
1. At least 15 contact hours of recitation, lecture, discussion,
seminar, or colloquium, as well as a minimum of 30 hours of student
homework are required for each unit of student credit.
<P>
2. Workshops require at least 15 through 45 contact hours and
the appropriate number of homework hours to comprise a total of
at least 45 hours of work for each unit of credit.
<P>
3. Studios require at least 30 contact hours and at least 15 hours
of homework for each unit of credit.
<P>
4. Laboratory courses must maintain a minimum of 45 contact hours
per unit of credit.
<P>
5. Field trips are to be counted hour-for-hour as laboratory meetings.
<P>
6. Each unit of internship or practicum must require a minimum
of 45 hours of work.
<P>
Since it would be virtually impossible for a student to complete
satisfactorily 45 hours of work in less than one week, the policy
regarding the duration of courses maintains that a course must
cover at least a one-week period for every unit of credit given.
During the summer session, however, 6 units of credit might be
given over a five-week period.
<P>
It is understood that, when the official university calendar deviates
from these guidelines, that calendar shall prevail.
<P>
It is also understood that the hour requirements specified above
represent minimums for average students and that considerable
deviation in excess of these requirements may occur, particularly
at the graduate level.
<P>
<B><A NAME="honors"></A>THE HONORS CENTER</B> 
<P>
Honors students participate in a personalized educational setting
that focuses on small classes, usually with no more than 15 students.
Honors faculty emphasize the development of analytic abilities,
verbal skills, writing, and problem solving. Course offerings
include Honors seminars, colloquia, introductory departmental
courses, and independent studies. Ample opportunities exist for
personalized research and laboratory work. In addition, students
can experience an exciting array of special offerings, a program
of faculty-student dialogues; peer mentoring sessions for incoming
freshman; study abroad opportunities; Honors Forum Luncheons;
and summer research grants. In most instances, a student's experience
culminates with the completion of an Honors Thesis during the
senior year.
<P>
Participation in Honors affords students a number of special privileges.
Honors students have extended library benefits, Honors computer
labs, special Honors academic advising, and early registration
for lower division students. For those who choose to live on campus,
members of the Honors Center are eligible to reside in one of
two residence halls reserved exclusively for Honors students (Yuma
Hall and Yavapai Hall).
<P>
Admission to Honors is limited to students who have distinguished
themselves academically. Incoming freshman must rank in the top
5% of their class or achieve a composite ACT score of 30 or a
combined SAT score of 1300. Transfer students must have a cumulative
3.5 grade point average on a 4.0 scale.
<P>
Participation in Honors encourages students to extend the boundaries
of their minds beyond the usual scope of university experience
and to discover new facets of their talents and abilities. The
Center provides opportunities which enhance the development of
the &quot;whole&quot; person - that individual who is sensitive,
humane, knowledgeable, inquisitive, and who seeks a clearer understanding
of the past, present, and future. For additional information regarding
this exciting program, contact the Honors Center, Slonaker House,
621-6901.

<P>
<B>Graduation with Academic Distinction<br>
</B> 
<font color="#800000">(Policy updated August 25, 2003: reference to graduates
with the Juris Doctor Degree deleted per request of the College of Law.)</font> 
<P>
Three categories are awarded for superior scholarship in work
leading to the bachelor's degree. This honor, based upon graduation
grade-point average, becomes part of the official record, is awarded
upon graduation and appears on the transcript and diploma of the
recipient.
<P>
1. <I>Summa Cum Laude</I> is awarded to candidates whose grade-point
average is 3.900 or higher.
<P>
2. <I>Magna Cum Laude</I> is awarded to candidates whose grade-point

the above grade-point averages, only work in residence is considered.
<P>
<B>Graduation with Honors</B> 
<P>
Graduation with Honors is bestowed on students who have completed
all requirements of the University-wide Honors Program. This academic
recognition becomes part of the official record and is noted on
the transcript and diploma of the recipient. Honors students also
wear a special stole at graduation.
<P>
<B>Other Awards and Honors</B> 
<P>
Other awards and honors in recognition of outstanding academic
achievement are bestowed through the various colleges and departments.
Also, colleges and departments offer participation in discipline-based
honor societies and associations. Interested students should contact
departmental and college advisors.
<P>
<B><A NAME="progress"></A>ACADEMIC PROGRESS, PROBATION AND DISQUALIFICATION</B>

<P>
<B>Academic Progress</B> 
<P>
Undergraduate students will be considered to be making normal
progress toward a degree if their cumulative grade-point average
for all work attempted at The University of Arizona is not less
than 2.000.
<P>
<B>Academic Warning Status</B> 
<P>
<font color="#FF0000">(Policy revised 2/10/06.&nbsp; As of Fall 2006, Academic 
Warning is no longer in effect.&nbsp; Students in all catalogs are subject to the 
Academic Probation policy stated in the 2006-07 Catalog:</font>
<a href="http://www.catalog.arizona.edu/2006-07/policies/acaprog.htm#Probation">&nbsp;http://catalog.arizona.edu/2006-07/policies/acaprog.htm#Probation</a><font color="#FF0000">).</font><P>
Freshman students who have completed fewer than 14 units at the
University with a University of Arizona cumulative grade-point
average between 1.750 and 2.000, or who have completed from 14
through 26 units at the University with a University of Arizona
cumulative grade-point average of between 1.840 and 2.000 will
be on academic warning status. Academic warning status invokes
no academic penalties and will not be indicated on the student's
permanent record. This status serves as a warning to students
beginning their college careers that their performance is below
the level required for successful completion of an academic program.
Students in this status are strongly urged to seek academic counseling.
<P>
<B>Probation</B> 
<P>
Students not meeting the standards of normal progress or academic
warning status will be on probation. Students on probation are
subject to such restrictions with respect to courses and extracurricular
activities as may be imposed by the academic dean of the college
in which the student is enrolled. Students are removed from probation
upon earning the minimum cumulative grade-point average required
by the table listed under &quot;Minimum Grade-Point Average Required&quot;
above.
<P>
<B>Disqualification</B> 
<P>
Disqualification is of two types: from a particular college in
the University or from the University. A student may be academically
disqualified only after two consecutive regular semesters of not
meeting the standards of normal progress (cumulative grade-point
average of 2.0) or academic warning status; or under conditions
described below under &quot;Probation or Disqualification by Special
Action&quot;.
<P>
The student recommended for disqualification from a particular
college may seek immediate admission to another college in the
University. Permission for admission to another college must be
obtained in writing from the dean of the college into which the
student plans to transfer. The letter of permission should be
presented to the Office of the Registrar. Ordinarily permission
will be granted only if the student plans to pursue a modified
program in a curriculum of the new college and has demonstrated
ability warranting such action. Those who have been given college
disqualification are strongly urged to seek thorough academic
and vocational counseling and guidance. Failure to secure approval
to transfer to another college in the University is tantamount
to university disqualification and the rules governing this type
of disqualification then will apply. A disqualified student may
not attend the University as a nondegree student.
<P>
A student disqualified from a particular college who may have
secured subsequent permission to register in another college is
automatically on scholastic probation in the new college. A student
may be granted college disqualification only once in his or her
academic career. Any later disqualification will be considered
a university disqualification.
<P>
<B>University Disqualification</B> 
<P>
A student who receives university disqualification is restricted
from registering at The University of Arizona and may return to
the University only on the basis of evidence that underlying conditions
have materially improved and that he or she is now capable of
academic success. Students seeking readmission who left the University
on academic probation or under disqualification must receive approval
from the dean of the college they wish to enter prior to readmission.
<P>
<B>Probation or Disqualification by Special Action</B> 
<P>
Upon recommendation of the dean of the college, a student may
be placed on scholastic probation or may be disqualified at any
time for neglect of academic work.
<P>
<B>Credit Restrictions for Students under University Disqualification</B>

<P>
<font color="#FF0000">(Policy revised 9/11/06.&nbsp; As of Fall 2006, there is no 
reference to correspondence enrollment.&nbsp; Students in all catalogs are subject to 
the Academic Disqualification policy stated in the 2006-07 Catalog:&nbsp;
<a href="../2006-07/policies/acaprog.htm#University ">
http://catalog.arizona.edu/2006-07/policies/acaprog.htm#University%20Disqualification)</a></font><P>
Students who are under disqualification from the University may
not take University of Arizona courses for credit or establish
credit by examination during their periods of disqualification,
although they may remove incomplete grades. With the permission
of the college dean concerned, students who have been disqualified
from the University may register for correspondence enrollment.
<P>
<B>CLASS INFORMATION POLICY</B> 
<P>
To assist students in achieving course goals, faculty teaching
undergraduate courses shall communicate the following information
to students during the first week of class: the faculty member's
name, office hours, office phone number, number of examinations
and papers, grade and absence policy, and the materials needed
for the class. In carrying out this requirement, faculty are strongly
encouraged to distribute this information in writing through an
information sheet or syllabus.

<P>
<B>Full-Time Student Status</B> 
<P>
Full-time status for an undergraduate student varies with the
college and study program, but ordinarily requires a load of at
least 12 units per semester. Full-time status for graduate students
is more widely variable, depending upon assistantship or associateship
duties and the composition of the individual student's program.
Students in doubt about their standing should check with the dean
of the college.
<P>
<B><A NAME="declare"></A>DECLARATION OF MAJOR</B> 
<P>
Students must declare a major by the beginning of their junior
year. For information regarding the number of units required for
junior status, see &quot;Class Standing&quot; in the Enrollment
Policies section elsewhere in this section of the catalog.
<P>
<B><A NAME="complete"></A>COMPLETION OF MAJOR</B> 
<P>
The academic experience at the University will be affected by
each student's personal situation, academic abilities, and continued
persistence toward an academic major. The University cannot guarantee
enrollment in some classes because of changing student interest
and enrollment fluctuations. In addition, some departments and
colleges limit the number of majors they admit each year. For
these reasons the University cannot guarantee that each student
will be able to complete requirements for the major of his or
her first preference with in a specific time frame. Students who
find a desired class closed should work with departmental faculty
and advisors to explore alternative classes and academic options
available at The University of Arizona.
<P>
<B><A NAME="petitions"></A>PETITIONS</B> 
<P>
Undergraduate students may petition the University Petitions Committee
for relief if they believe they deserve redress or exception to
university rules, regulations, or policies regarding academic
affairs, such as extension of incomplete grade, choice of catalog
and degree requirements. Petition forms may be obtained in the
Office of the Registrar or from the college dean. The completed
form with all relevant facts and supporting evidence is submitted
to the college dean for recommendation and forwarding to the Office
of the Registrar, after which it is forwarded to the University
Petitions Committee for action. The decision of the University
Petitions Committee is final.
<P>
Students may also petition for redress or exception to college
policies or requirements. Petitions may address a change of program,
approval for an overload, substitution of course work, transfer
credit, modification in degree program, or in certain instances,
eligibility for registration or enrollment in the college. The
necessary forms, instructions and assistance may be obtained in
the office of the college dean. The decision of the dean is final.
<P>
Graduate students should consult the Graduate College for information
on submitting petitions.
<P>
<B><A NAME="grades"></A>GRADING SYSTEM</B>

The grade of K is assigned for all supplementary registration
(930) at the time of enrollment and will remain permanently on
the student's academic record.
<P>
For any course, other than the 900 series, that requires more
than one semester for completion, the grade of K is awarded by
the Office of the Registrar at the end of the semester and carried
to the next semester.

Students may withdraw from classes in accord with the following
policies. Prior to the end of the fourth week of classes, official
withdrawal (drop) of a course cancels the registration for the
course; a dean's approval is not required. Weeks five through
ten, the grade of W is awarded to students who are passing at
the time of withdrawal; the grade of E may be awarded to students
not passing at the time of withdrawal. Both grades show on the
student's permanent record. After the tenth week of classes, the
grade of W can be awarded only with the approval of the student's
academic dean, and only under exceptional circumstances. For other
regulations concerning withdrawal, see the section on &quot;Change
of Schedule.&quot; The W may also be awarded in the case of complete
withdrawal from the University. See &quot;Withdrawal&quot; under
<I>Leaving the University</I>.

<B>Audit Grade</B> 
<P>
The grade of O is awarded for courses taken for audit. This grade
is not awarded unless the student is registered for audit.

</B><font color="#FF0000"><i>Grade-Point-Average Calculation: Wording change to clarify calculation of 
cumulative GPA</i></font> 
<P>
For the purpose of computing grade-point averages, grade points are assigned to 
each grade as follows: A, 4 points for each semester unit; B, 3 points; C, 2 
points; D, 1 point; and E, 0 points. The grade-point-average is the arithmetic mean of the grade points earned for 
all credits taken at the University of Arizona for

Special Examination for Grade</a>, where regular grades are awarded. Ordinarily 
cumulative GPAs are calculated using only the courses at the career level of the 
student. For example, the undergraduate GPA is based on undergraduate courses 
only (see <a href="../2005-06/policies/enrpol.htm#gradcreditseniors">Graduate

<P>
<B>Grade Appeal</B> 
<P>
&lt;A student who feels that a grade has been unfairly awarded
may appeal. Before a student begins the appeal process, s/he should
make a serious effort to resolve the problem by discussing the
concerns with the course instructor, stating the reasons for questioning
the grade. If the instructor is a graduate student and this interview
does not resolve the difficulty, the student should discuss the
problem with the person in charge of the course.The grade appeal
process <I>per se</I> begins with the student going to the college
dean's office to receive direction and any requisite forms. The
student must attest that s/he has informed the instructor that
s/he intends to file a grade appeal. This step must be taken within
the first five weeks of classes of the first regular semester
after the semester or summer term in which the grade was awarded.
Only in exceptional cases shall a grade appeal be processed during
a summer session. The dean of the college in which the course
was offered shall determine if the case is exceptional and warrants
immediate review. The dean shall also have the authority to extend
the deadlines for the steps in a grade appeal, but only in extraordinary
circumstances shall the appeal process extend beyond the end of
the first regular semester following the awarding of the grade
without the consent of all parties involved. The dean's decision
on whether or not the time constraints have been satisfied shall
be final.
<P>
Having carefully formulated the nature of the appeal in writing,
the student shall present the written appeal to the instructor.
The student shall also present the written appeal to the department
office for verification of the date of contact. These steps must
also be taken within the first five weeks of classes of the first
regular semester after the semester or summer terms in which the
grade was awarded. If the instructor or the person in charge of
the course is unavailable when the student initially attempts
to make contact, the student shall request the department head
or his or her representative to verify the date of contact. Within
two weeks from the date of receipt of the student's written statement,
the instructor and/or the person in charge of the course shall
respond in writing, explaining the grading procedures and how
the grade in question was determined as well as other issues raised
in the student's statement.
<P>
If the instructor is not available during the two weeks following
the date of contact or does not resolve the matter to the student's
satisfaction within the two-week period, the student shall within
one week thereafter appeal in writing to the head of the department
through which the course was offered. After considering the student's
written statement and the instructor's written statement, and
after conferring with either or both as necessary, the department
head shall inform the instructor and the student in writing whether
or not he or she recommends a change in grade. If a change in
grade is recommended, the instructor may refuse to accept the
recommendation. The department head shall not have the authority
to change the grade.
<P>
If the student wishes to pursue the matter further or if the department
head does not act within the two-week period, the student shall
within one week thereafter appeal in writing to the dean of the
college concerned. The dean shall convene a committee to review
the case. The committee shall consist of five members, one selected
from the faculty of the department of the instructor concerned,
two from the faculty of another closely related department or
college, and two students provided by the student council of the
college concerned. If the college does not have a student council,
the ASUA shall appoint the student members, selecting full-time
upper-division undergraduate students for a grade appeal by an
undergraduate student or two full-time graduate students for a
grade appeal by a graduate student. All student members must be
in good academic standing.
<P>
Within the structure provided by the dean, the committee shall
design its own rules of operation. The student and instructor
shall represent themselves. The committee may, or may not, (a)
meet separately with the student, the instructor, and the department
head, (b) request each party to submit a brief written summary
statement of the issues, and/or (c) interview other persons who
have relevant information. The committee shall consider all aspects
of the case pertaining to the grade determination in rendering
its recommendation. If feasible, the committee should meet with
the student and the instructor together in an attempt to resolve
the differences. At the conclusion of its work, the committee
shall make a written report containing its recommendations and
provide copies to the student concerned, the instructor, the department
head, and the dean.
<P>
The appointment, meeting, and recommendation of the committee
and the final action of the dean shall be made within four weeks
of the dean's receipt of the student's written appeal. Final action
on the case shall be taken by the dean only after full consideration
of the committee's recommendation. The dean shall have the authority
to change the grade and the registrar shall accept the dean's
judgment. The department head, the instructor, and the student
shall be notified in writing of the outcome of the dean's judgment.
<P>
The student may request written verification of receipt of his
or her letters of appeal from instructor, department head, and
dean.
<P>

<B>Repeating a Course</B> 
<P>
Students wishing to repeat course work at The University of Arizona
may elect one of the following options:
<P>
1. <I>Establishment of Credit:</I> Undergraduate students may
repeat any course for which they have received an E or W. They
may repeat this course as many times as necessary to establish
credit, but may only be eligible for grade replacement once.
<P>
2. <I>First and Second Attempt Averaging:</I> Undergraduate students
may repeat only once any course in which they have received original
grades of C or D. Grade-point average will be computed by averaging
grades earned in the first and second attempt. Original grades
of A or B may not be repeated, except as specifically provided
by departments on a course-by-course basis. Credit will be allowed
only once unless the course is designated &quot;repeatable for
credit&quot; by the department.
<P>
3. <I>Grade Replacement:</I> 
<P>
<font color="#FF0000">(Policy updated 1/10/06)<br>
<i>Wording change to clarify individual studies</i></font><P>
Undergraduates who have not received
a bachelor's degree from the University may repeat only once courses
in which they received grades of C, D, or E. Three courses not
to exceed a maximum of 10 units may be replaced. Students must
file a request in the Registrar's Office within the first four
weeks of the semester or the first week of a summer term, Presession
or Winter Session. Grades earned in the first and second attempt
will remain on the academic record, but the grade earned in the
second attempt will be used in the grade-point average, even if
lower than the first attempt. Grades of (O) or (W) will count
as an attempt, but will not replace the original grade. A repeated
course will replace only one previous grade. Units earned will
not be affected by this policy, but duplicate units cannot apply
towards a degree program. Courses originally taken for Pass/Fail are not allowed
to be repeated.<P>
&quot;Credit by Exam&quot;, &quot;Grade by Exam&quot;, &quot;Individual Studies&quot; courses, 
&quot;Correspondence&quot; courses, and &quot;Pass/Fail&quot; courses cannot be taken under GRO. 
Individual Studies is defined as courses with numbers ending in 91 (Preceptorship), 
93 (internship), 94 (practicum), and 99 (independent study).<P>
<B>Pass-Fail Option</B> 
<P>
For certain courses, a qualified student may elect to register
under the pass-fail option. Under such registration, the only
final grades available to the student are P (pass) or F (fail).
<P>
Undergraduate students may elect to take courses under the pass-fail
option only after they have attained sophomore standing and only
if they have earned grade-point averages of 2.000 or better.
<P>
Students registering for a course under the pass-fail option must
meet the prerequisites or otherwise satisfy the instructor of
their ability to take the course.
<P>
Undergraduate students may register under the pass-fail option
for not more than two courses per semester up to a maximum of
12 courses. Further, they must carry a minimum of 12 units of
regular grades other than P/F during each semester in which they
elect courses under the pass-fail option. Any exceptions to this
policy must be approved by the student's academic dean.
<P>
Courses taken under the pass-fail option must be electives only,
and may not be used to fulfill major, minor, or other specified
curriculum requirements.
<P>
The pass-fail option is not generally available to graduate students.
The only exceptions to this proscription are: (a) admission deficiencies
which the student has prior specific, written approval to take
on a P/F basis (only the department head or the departmental graduate
adviser may give such approval, which must be on file in the Graduate
College office before registration); (b) any undergraduate nondeficiency
course available for P/F grading; and (c) any course offered by
the College of Law.
<P>
Each department decides which of its courses will be available
under the pass-fail option. Pass-fail courses in the 500, 600,
or 700 series may be offered only in law. Further, the instructor
of the course must approve of its being offered pass-fail. The
instructor shall be informed by the Registrar which students are
enrolled under the pass-fail option.
<P>
Students may change from pass-fail enrollment to enrollment for
a regular grade, or vice versa, only during the time period prior
to the last day of the fourth calendar week during which classes
are held, except with special permission of the student's college
dean.
<P>
If a course is taken under the pass-fail option, the grade of
P or F will be permanently recorded. However, neither grade will
be included in the average. If the course is passed, the units
of credit will be applied toward graduation.
<P>
<I>COLLEGE OF MEDICINE</I> - All courses in the College of Medicine
are graded on a pass-fail system for medical students.
<P>
<I>TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION</I> - Pass/fail grades are the
only grades available for 493a and 493b. Enrollment in these courses
will not reduce the amount for which a student can otherwise enroll
under the pass-fail option.
<P>
<B><A NAME="gened"></A>GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS</B> 
<P>
General education programs provide <I>breadth</I> of knowledge
as a balance and complement to the <I>depth</I> provided by the
major. General education is designed to accomplish several goals:
First, to afford students the opportunity to learn how different
disciplines define, acquire and organize knowledge; second, to
enhance understanding of the reciprocal influences of Western
and non-Western cultures; third, to provide a basis for an examination
of values; fourth to develop analytic, synthetic, linguistic and
computational skills useful for lifelong learning; and finally,
to provide a common foundation for wide-ranging dialogue with
peers on issues of significance. Taken together, the experiences
of general education encourage the student to develop a critical
and inquiring attitude, an appreciation of complexity and ambiguity,
a tolerance for and empathy with persons of different backgrounds
or values and a deepened sense of one's own self. In short, the
goal of the general education program is to prepare students to
respond more fully and effectively to an increasingly complex
world.
<P>
General education requirements vary across colleges and departments.
However, all general education programs at The University of Arizona
share a common structure. Each requires courses in basic skills
and competencies, including freshman composition, as well as courses
in particular areas, such as biological and physical sciences,
arts and literature, social sciences, and traditions and cultures.
For specific details on general education requirements, see the
<I>College and General Divisions</I> section of this catalog.
Also, students are advised to check with college and department
offices for current lists of courses that meet general education
requirements.
<P>
<B>UNIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS IN COMPOSITION</B> 
<P>
The University of Arizona has long regarded sound training in
writing as indispensable to the academic development of an educated
person; clear, intelligent writing is a skill required of all
university graduates. First year Composition, the Upper-Division
Writing-Proficiency Examination, and a writing-emphasis course
are required of all students.
<P>
<B>First-Year Composition<br>
</B> 
<font color="#800000">(Policy updated December 5, 2003:&nbsp; added options for transfer
students)</font> 
<P>
All students working toward degrees must meet the first-year composition
requirement by completing one of the following sequences: ENGL
100-101-102, ENGL 101-102, ENGL 103H-104H, ENGL 106-107-108, ENGL
107-108, ENGL 109H. There is no exemption from the first-year
composition requirement; any substitutes must be approved by the
Director of Composition, Department of English. The first-year
composition requirement may not be satisfied by correspondence
work.
<P>
Placement in first-year composition takes into account the student's
performance on two examinations: (1) A written placement essay
administered at the time a student first registers for a course
in composition, (2) the English section of the American College
Test (ACT) or the verbal score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT). Both of these examinations require fees. Students with
superior ratings based on the above examinations enroll initially
in ENGL 103H; students whose scores indicate a need for more extensive
instruction in writing initially enroll in ENGL 100 and pass this
course before they enroll in ENGL 101. International students
write a placement essay and submit a score on the Test of English
as a Foreign Language. Students whose scores indicate a need for
more extensive instruction in writing initially enroll in ENGL
106 and pass this course before they enroll in ENGL 107. Students
who earn a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Exam administered
by the College Board, or a score of 5, 6, or 7 on the International
Baccalaureate Examination have the option of enrolling in ENGL
109H and satisfying the requirement in one semester.
<p>Transfer students who are admitted with 56 transferable units or who have
earned a previous bachelor's degree from another institution may satisfy the
English Composition requirement by submitting to the Writing Program
coordinator, Modern Languages Building, Room 380, one of the following for
consideration:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A catalog course description or syllabus for 2 transferable
    composition/writing courses that do not fulfill another UA degree
    requirement.
  <li>A portfolio of 3 - 4 writing samples (an adequate sample consists of 15 -
    20 pages illustrating an analytical, argumentative, or critical response to
    a text) from courses completed at the transfer institution.
  <li>A catalog course description for 1 transferable composition/writing course
    that is not used to satisfy another degree requirement, in addition to a
    portfolio of writing samples (see above).</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon approval by the Writing Program coordinator of 2 transferable
composition/writing courses or portfolio of writing samples, the first-year
English Composition requirement will be satisfied.&nbsp; All questions about
first-year composition should be directed to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Modern Languages 380<br>
  The University of Arizona<br>
  P.O. Box 210067<br>
  Tucson, AZ 85721-0067<br>
  Phone: (520) 621-5976</p>
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>The Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination</B> 
<P>
Every student must take the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency
Examination, which is a prerequisite to enrolling in a writing-emphasis
course (see below). Students may take the exam after they have
satisfied the first-year composition requirement and accumulated
at least 40 but less than 75 credit hours toward their degree.
Students who have accumulated more than 75 credit hours should
take the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination as soon
as possible. Students register for the exam with the University
Composition Board (Modern Languages 380). Students must have taken
the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination before their
application for Bachelor's Degree Candidacy will be accepted.
<P>
The examination may be taken only once. Results are reported to
students and to their major departments. Students who earn an
evaluation of unsatisfactory on the exam usually are required
by their department to complete further work in composition before
registering for writing-emphasis courses. They should consult
with their academic advisors for specific information about their
department's requirements.
<P>
<B>Writing-Emphasis Classes</B> 
<P>
Every undergraduate degree program includes at least one required
writing-emphasis course. Writing-emphasis courses are regular
junior or senior level courses in an academic discipline in which
at least half the grade awarded is determined by written work
appropriate to the academic discipline. Such courses are identified
with the phrase &quot;writing-emphasis course&quot; at the end
of the course description listed in the <I>Departments and Courses
of Instruction </I>section of this catalog. Prerequisite to a
writing-emphasis course is satisfactory performance on the Upper-Division
Writing-Proficiency Examination or, in the case of students whose
papers are evaluated as unsatisfactory on the examination, further
developmental work in writing, as prescribed by an academic advisor.
<P>
<B>UNIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS IN MATHEMATICS</B> 
<P>
<B>Mathematics Readiness Test</B> 
<P>
Prior to taking any mathematics course below the level of 125b
at The University of Arizona, students must take the math readiness
test. The test is administered by the Testing Office in Old Main
and the results are valid for one year. Students without university
credit in the prerequisites for 116, 122, 117R, 117S, 118, 119,
121, 123, 124, 125a will be required to have an appropriate score
on the math readiness test to be enrolled in those courses.
<P>
<B>EXAMINATIONS</B> 
<P>
<B>Mid-Semester Examinations</B> 
<P>
It is expected that all mid-semester examinations will occur during
a regularly scheduled class period of the course. For those multiple-section
courses in which it is impossible to offer mid-semester examinations
during the regular class period, the following requirements for
offering the examination at an alternate time must be met: (1)
the course shall be identified in the schedule of classes as requiring
combined hourly examinations at a time different from the regular
class period; (2) the times at which combined hourly examinations
will be given shall be listed in the schedule of classes; (3)
the controlling academic dean shall approve such action in advance;
and (4) students whose schedules conflict with the time scheduled
for the combined examination shall be provided an alternate time
for taking the examination.
<P>
<B>Final Examinations</B> 
<P>
All courses offered for credit shall include a final examination
given at the regularly scheduled examination time. No deviation
from the exam schedule, once it is printed, is authorized. All
forms of examinations (quizzes, take-homes, etc.) are prohibited
on any scheduled class day during the week in which regularly
scheduled final exams begin. Specific exceptions for certain courses
may be granted by obtaining prior approval from the appropriate
department and academic dean. Students shall be informed of any
such exceptions prior to the end of the fourth week of classes.
<P>
<B><A NAME="profic"></A>PROFICIENCY AND EXEMPTION EXAMINATIONS,
CREDIT BY EXAMINATION</B> 
<P>
Students may establish credit or proficiency in various disciplines
under any of several modes. They are:
<P>
1. The Advanced Placement program administered by the College
Board;
<P>
2. The Higher Level Examinations of the International Baccalaureate;
<P>
3. The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) (also administered
by the College Board);
<P>
4. Departmental exemption or proficiency examinations;
<P>
5. Special examination for credit or grade.
<P>
In no case may the sum of credits earned through the above examinations
and/or University of Arizona correspondence courses exceed 60
units applied toward an undergraduate degree. No graduate credit
may be established in this manner.
<P>
<B><A NAME="advanced"></A>Advanced Placement from High School</B>

<P>
The Advanced Placement program recognizes that certain students
are often able to complete college-level courses while attending
high school. The College Board provides course descriptions and
professional consultants to help schools establish college-level
courses. The program administers and grades the examinations and
sends the results to the students' prospective colleges.
<P>
Successful completion of these examinations, which are administered
in the student's high school, entitles the student to be considered
for advanced placement, granted college credit, or both, depending
upon the area and the examination scores. Advanced placement <I>without</I>
credit does not reduce the total units to be earned for the bachelor's
degree, but allows the student to study at a higher level than
otherwise possible. Advanced placement <I>with</I> credit reduces
the units to be completed for a degree. Final decision regarding
credit or placement is the prerogative of the department concerned.
The three top scores on Advanced Placement examinations are 5,
4, and 3; in many cases, a placement score of at least 3 will
suffice for advanced placement and credit.
<P>
No grades are recorded for courses credited through the Advanced
Placement program.
<P>
University policy encourages prospective students to avail themselves
of Advanced Placement programs, because successful achievement
will substantially increase flexibility in future course selection.

<P>
<B><A NAME="clep"></A>College-Level Examination Program (CLEP)</B>

<P><font color="#800000">(Updated November 3, 2003; added note to Foreign
Language.)</font>

<P>
The examinations offered under the CLEP were designed primarily
to allow people who may not have been formal students for many
years to achieve college-level credit for knowledge acquired through
self-education and experience. By successful performance on CLEP
examinations, many have been encouraged to pursue further a college
or university education.
<P>
Additionally, these examinations are seen increasingly as of value
to students formally engaged in degree programs, as a means of
satisfying certain course or area requirements, or for earning
extra course credits, without having to enroll formally in the
courses. General and subject exams must be taken by UA students
prior to the completion of 55 units. Transfer students must take
general and subject exams before finishing 55 units or before
completing two regular semesters at the University. Students should
consult their academic advisers or the offices of their college
deans for more information.
<P>
All CLEP examinations are available through the Testing Office
at The University of Arizona. A limited list of CLEP examinations
is available also through the testing centers at Arizona State
University and Northern Arizona University. Resident students
at The University of Arizona should contact the Testing Office
for additional information.
<P>
The University of Arizona accepts for college credit both the
General and the Subject examinations of the CLEP, providing satisfactory
scores are attained. Scores of 500 or better on the General examinations
will entitle the student, upon registration at the university,
to 6 units of credit in each of the following General examinations:
(1) English Composition; (2) Mathematics; (3) Natural Sciences;
(4) Social Sciences-History; and to four units of credit for Humanities.
<P>
From 3 to 16 units of credit, depending upon the examination,
may be earned by scores of 50 or better on most subject examinations
(41 for College French, 40 for College German, and 41 for College
Spanish). The number of units of credit earned is listed in parentheses
following the corresponding test indicated below.

<P>
<I>Note:</I> A maximum of 6 semester hours of general elective
credit will be allowed for completion of one or more of the following:
Subject Examination in College Composition, Subject Examination
in freshman English, General Examination in English Composition.
Whether this credit will satisfy the University Freshman English
requirement is determined by the Director of Composition following
interview and written performance.
<P>
CLEP credit in English, in composition or literature, may not
be applied toward either an English major or minor.
<P>
For both prospective and currently enrolled students utilizing
CLEP examinations, credit will not be awarded in subjects at the
same level. In addition, resident students will not be awarded
credit through CLEP for courses equivalent to, or at a lower level
than, other courses they have already established in formal course
work.
<P>
Passing scores for subjects credited through the CLEP are recorded
simply as CR (credit), and may not necessarily be stated in terms
of a specific course equivalent. No record is made of failing
scores.
<P>
<B>Exemption or Proficiency Examinations</B> 
<P>
A number of colleges and departments regularly offer exemption
or proficiency examinations covering introductory or basic areas
of their disciplines. These examinations are designed and graded
by the individual departments. No credit is awarded on the basis
of successful performance on these, but they allow a student two
privileges: (a) the opportunity of enrolling in advanced-level
courses in the area of proficiency; or (b) the opportunity of
satisfying various college or departmental &quot;area&quot; or
proficiency requirements without taking prescribed courses.
<P>
Proficiency or exemption examinations for many courses are available
to any student currently enrolled in a degree program at the university.
Capable students wishing to increase their elective freedom are
encouraged by university policy to examine the opportunities provided
through the various proficiency examinations.
<P>
At the discretion of the department, the proficiency examination
may include laboratory projects or other evidence of satisfactory
skills in addition to or instead of the written examination. A
fee is normally charged for these examinations.
<P>
<I>FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY EXAMINATIONS</I> - It is possible
for students to satisfy language requirements in whole or in part
by passing a noncredit proficiency examination at the two- or
four-semester level.
<P>
Foreign students will be allowed credit by transfer in their native
language only for those courses taken during the years equivalent
to the United States college years.
<P>
The completion of the course levels set in this paragraph satisfies
the requirement: ARB 402; CHN 402 (Modern Chinese); FREN 202;
GER 202; GRK 202; JUS 403b (Hebrew); ITAL 202; JPN 202 (Japanese);
LAT 202; PRS 405b; PORT 206; RUSS 201a or 201b; SPAN 202, 206.
<P>
Passing the proficiency examination at the required level in a
foreign language fulfills the language requirement in colleges
requiring a foreign language. Passing a <I>course</I> for which
the required level is prerequisite also establishes proficiency
in that language. Credit may not be earned merely by passing the
proficiency examination.
<P>
<B>Procedures and General Regulations for Exemption or Proficiency
Examinations</B> 
<P>
1. Proficiency or exemption examinations are available only to
students enrolled in degree programs.
<P>
2. In no case does passing an exemption or proficiency examination
lower the total number of units required for the bachelor's degree.
<P>
3. In normal circumstances, a student may not take a proficiency
examination for the same course more than twice.
<P>
4. Proficiency or exemption examinations are normally given early
in the semester or during summer orientation. The student must
contact the appropriate department concerned for additional information
and instructions.
<P>
5. Students wishing to sit for a proficiency or exemption examination
in a language not normally taught must contact the Office of the
Dean of Arts and Sciences for information.
<P>
6. The exemption or proficiency examinations are administered
only on the University of Arizona campus.
<P>
7. The results of exemption or proficiency examinations, if successful,
are reported in writing directly to the Office of the Registrar,
with a copy to the student.
<P>
8. The student's academic record will be annotated with a statement
indicating the student passed the proficiency examination at the
appropriate level.
<P>
<B>Special Examination for Credit or Grade</B> 
<P>
Any student currently enrolled or previously withdrawn in good
standing at the University of Arizona may earn credit toward an
undergraduate degree through the use of special examinations.
The responsibility for preparatory study for these examinations
rests entirely with the student; faculty members are under no
obligation to assist with such preparation.
<P>
Special examinations are constructed and administered by the department
concerned. They are designed to reflect and explore the scholastic
equivalent of the course, and are more comprehensive than the
usual &quot;final exam.&quot; The examinations may be written
or oral, or both, and they may include course projects, laboratory
projects, written reports, or other evidence of proficiency.
<P>
Undergraduate courses currently offered by the University and
designated in the catalog &quot;CDT&quot; may be taken for credit
by examination. Courses designated &quot;GRD&quot; may be taken
for grade by examination or credit by examination. Other courses
generally have been excluded from this option; at department discretion,
however, any course may be made available for grade by examination
or credit by examination.
<P>
<B>Options</B> 
<P>
1. Special Examination for Credit: Passing grades, recorded as
&quot;CR&quot; (credit), become a permanent part of the student's
record but are not used in computing the cumulative grade average.
Failing grades are not recorded.
<P>
2. Special Examination for Grade: All grades, whether passing
or failing, are permanently recorded and used in computing the
cumulative grade average.
<P>
<B>Limitations</B> 
<P>
1. The credit so earned may not duplicate units already presented
for admission to the University, either collegiate or subcollegiate.
<P>
2. The credit may not be in a course which is equivalent to, or
more elementary than, another course in which the student is enrolled
or for which the student has already received credit. The head
of the examining department has the responsibility of determining
the application of this limitation in each student's case.
<P>
3. No credit may be earned by this type of examination for beginning
or intermediate language courses in the native language of the
applicant.
<P>
<B>Procedures</B> 
<P>
1. Applications for Special Examination for Credit or Special
Examination for Grade may be obtained from the Registrar.
<P>
2. The application must be approved by the student's advisor.
<P>
3. The examining instructor and the head of the examining department
must determine the eligibility of the applicant and sign the application.
<P>
4. The application is returned to the Registrar, and the $21-per-unit
fee is paid to the University Cashier. No department may schedule
a special examination until notified by the Cashier that the fee
has been paid.
<P>
5. The examination is scheduled by the faculty member responsible,
normally during the same semester in which the application is
made.
<P>
6. The grade (CR or letter grade) is reported to the Registrar.
The examination, together with the student's graded examination
paper and any appropriate evaluations of oral performance or projects,
is then filed with the department for at least one year.
<P>
7. The student may change the type of special examination for
those courses designated &quot;GRD&quot; in the catalog any time
before the scheduled hour of the examination by filing a new application.
No additional fee will be charged.

<P><B><A NAME="grad"></A>GRADUATE CREDIT FOR SENIORS</B> 
<font color="#CC0000">(Policy updated May 23, 2003: clarification on
the use of 500-level courses toward the bachelor's and graduate degrees, and
the use of graduate and professional transfer courses.)</font></p>

<p>A senior within 15 units of completing requirements for graduation may
register for graduate work if recommended by the head of the department
offering the course and approved by the Dean of the Graduate College. A
petition for Undergraduate Enrollment in Graduate Courses must be filed with
the Graduate College at the time of registration or within 10 days thereafter.
The Dean of the Graduate College will not approve a petition unless the senior
has a grade-point-average (GPA) of 3.000 or better on all University Credit
and is proceeding toward graduation as directly as possible. Under such a petition, seniors may enroll in 500-level courses for undergraduate or graduate credit (not both). Courses
numbered at the 600, 700, and 900 levels are not open to undergraduates.</p>

<p>Just as graduate University Credit may be applied toward a bachelor's
degree (as upper division credit) or a graduate degree (as graduate credit),
graduate or professional level credit earned and transferred from another
institution may be applied toward a baccalaureate degree at the UA only if it
is not used to complete a graduate or professional degree at that institution.
Professional degrees include (but are not limited to) such programs as law and
medicine. Students may petition the acceptance of graduate or professional
credit by submitting a Transfer Credit Appeal, along with a letter from the
graduate or professional college stating that the courses in question were
not/are not being applied toward a graduate or professional degree at that
institution.</p>

<P>
<B><A NAME="absences"></A>ABSENCES - ADMINISTRATIVE DROP</B> 
<P>
Students are expected to be regular and punctual in class attendance.
The University believes that students themselves are primarily
responsible for attendance. Instructors will provide students
with written statements of their policies with respect to absences.
Excessive or extended absence from class is sufficient reason
for the instructor to recommend that the student be administratively
dropped from the course. For those courses in which enrollment
is limited, missing the first class session may be interpreted
as excessive absence. If this action is filed in the Registrar's
Office by the end of the fourth week of classes, it will result
in cancellation of registration in the course. If the student
is administratively dropped after the end of the fourth week of
classes, it will result in a failing grade being awarded in that
course.
<P>
The student may notify the Office of the Dean of Students when
an absence from class of one week or more is unavoidable. The
office will maintain a file of such reports available to instructors
upon request.
<P>
<B><A NAME="code"></A>SCHOLASTIC WORK - CODE OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</B>

<P>
Integrity is expected of every student in all academic work. The
guiding principle of academic integrity is that a student's submitted
work must be the student's own. Students engaging in academic
dishonesty diminish their education and bring discredit to the
academic community. Students shall not violate the Code of Academic
Integrity and shall avoid situations likely to compromise academic
integrity. Students shall observe the provisions of the Code whether
or not faculty members establish special rules of academic integrity
for particular classes. Failure of faculty to prevent cheating
does not excuse students from compliance with the Code.
<P>
Conduct prohibited by the Code consists of all forms of academic
dishonesty, including, but not limited to: cheating, fabrication,
facilitating academic dishonesty, and plagiarism as set out and
defined in the Code of Conduct, modifying any academic work for
the purpose of obtaining additional credit after such work has
been submitted to the supervising faculty member unless the supervising
faculty member approves such alterations; failure to observe rules
of academic integrity established by a faculty member for a particular
course; and attempting to commit any act prohibited by the Code.
Any attempt to commit an act prohibited by these rules shall be
subject to sanctions to the same extent as completed acts. The
procedures for reviewing a suspected violation follow.
<P>
<I>Faculty-Student Conference</I>. The faculty member must confer
with the student within 15 working days of his/her being informed
of a suspected violation.
<P>
<I>Appeal to Department Head.</I> The student must appeal to the
Department Head within ten working days of notification of the
imposition of sanctions and recommendations for suspension or
expulsion. The Department Head shall render a decision within
15 working days.
<P>
<I>University Hearing Board.</I> The student must appeal to the
University Hearing Board within ten working days of notification
that the Department Head has upheld the sanction or that the faculty
member refuses to accept the Department Head's recommendation
that sanction(s) be rescinded. The University Hearing Board shall
convene within 30 working days of the time the student files the
appeal.

of Academic Integrity. Copies are available in the Dean of Students
office.

<P>
<B>Dismissal from Courses or from the University</B> 
<P>
Reprehensible conduct or failure to comply with university regulations
may result in a student's dismissal from a course or from the
University at any time. The Dean of Students Office is responsible
for this procedure. Such action may be posted on the student's
academic record. Students suspended from the University are denied
student privileges during the period of suspension, and may not
register for correspondence work except with permission of the
dean of the college in which they have previously registered.
They may not enroll in Extended University courses, nor establish
credit by examination during the period of suspension.
<P>
<B>Medical Withdrawal</B> 
<P>
Medical withdrawal is initiated from the Student Health Service.
Adequate medical documentation must be supplied by the student.
Students who withdraw from the University for medical reasons
and who are medically encumbered must have their readmittances
approved by the Student Health Service.
<P>
<B>Retroactive Withdrawal</B> 
<P>
Under appropriate circumstances a student may petition for withdrawal
after completion of classes for a term. If the student has experienced
severe physical or psychological stress of such nature as to prevent
satisfactory completion of course work in the semester or term
in question, the student may petition for retroactive withdrawal
for all courses taken that semester or term. This petition must
be accompanied by adequate documentation and filed with the dean
of the student's college.
<P>
<B>Transcripts</B> 
<P>
Official University of Arizona transcripts are issued to other
institutions, offices or agencies designated in writing by the
student. (See &quot;Transcript Fee&quot; in <I>Expenses and Fees</I>
section.)
<P>
<B><A NAME="require"></A>General Graduation Requirement Information</B>

<P>
<B>Choice Of Catalog</B> 
<P>
Students maintaining continuous enrollment at any public Arizona
community college or university may graduate according to the
requirements of the catalog in effect at the time of initial enrollment
or according to the requirements identified in any single catalog
in effect during subsequent terms of continuous enrollment. This
determination of continuous enrollment applies to students when
they enroll at one of the public community colleges or universities
in Arizona, as well as to students who transfer between public
institutions in the state of Arizona.
<P>
1. A semester will be counted toward continuous enrollment when
a student earns at least one credit hour. Summer terms/sessions
are included in the determination of consecutive semesters for
continuous enrollment. Enrollment in one or more summer terms/sessions
is considered the equivalent of a semester for the purpose of
this policy. Noncredit courses, audited courses, <BR>
or courses from which the student withdraws before completion
do not count toward the determination of continuous enrollment
for catalog choice purposes.
<P>
2. Students who fail to meet the minimum enrollment standard as
defined in paragraph 1 during three or more consecutive semesters
at any public Arizona community college or university are no longer
considered continuously enrolled and must meet requirements of
the public Arizona community college or university catalog in
effect at the time they are readmitted or of a subsequent catalog
after readmission while they remain continuously enrolled.
<P>
3. First-time students or noncontinuous students reapplying for
admission to an Arizona public community college or university
during a summer term must follow the requirements of the catalog
in effect the following fall semester or any subsequent catalog
as long as they are continuously enrolled.
<P>
4. Students transferring between the Arizona public higher education
institutions are subject to the admission requirements of the
receiving institution, must fulfill the residency requirements
of the institution awarding the degree, and are responsible for
completing all curricular and academic requirements of the degree-granting
institution.
<P>
<B>Time Limit For Obsolete Course Work</B> 
<P>
In areas of study in which the subject matter changes rapidly,
material in courses taken long before graduation may become obsolete
or irrelevant. Courses or degree requirements which are more than
eight years old are applicable toward completion of a degree at
the discretion of the student's major department. Accreditation
may limit the applicability of courses or degree requirements
to less than eight years. Departments may approve, disapprove,
or request that the students revalidate the substance of such
courses. Students whose programs include courses that will be
more than 8 years old at the expected time of graduation should
consult with their major department at the earliest possible time,
to determine acceptability of such courses.
<P>
<B>Graduation Average</B> 
<P>
<font color="#FF0000">(Policy update 1/29/08, clarifying grades to be included)</font><P>
A graduation average of 2.000 for all University Credit course work undertaken 
and for any work satisfied by the Special Examination for Grade is required for 
the bachelor's degree. Note: The graduation grade average is based only on 
University Credit grades awarded prior to the graduation date, when all degree 
requirements have been satisfied.<P>
<B>Major Average</B> 
<P>
Majors for undergraduate degrees require an average of 2.000 or
better for <I>all </I>University Credit work undertaken in the
major field or for any work satisfied by the Special Examination
for Grade if in the major.
<P>
<B>University Credit Requirement</B> 
<P>
A minimum of 30 units of University Credit from The University
of Arizona is required for the bachelor's degree. It is further
required that 18 of the final 30 units offered toward the degree
be University Credit. Various departments have specific University
Credit requirements for their majors, and students should consult
individual departmental information sections for this information.
For a definition of University Credit, see &quot;University Credit&quot;
under <I>Academic Policies and Graduation Requirements </I>elsewhere
in this catalog
<P>
<B>Upper-Division Unit Requirement</B> 
<P>
The University of Arizona recognizes both breadth and depth of
knowledge as important characteristics of a baccalaureate degree.
To insure depth of study beyond introductory levels, the University
has a general policy requiring students to complete a minimum
of 42 units of upper-division course work for graduation. This
requirement applies to students graduating under the 1991-93 catalog
or any subsequent catalog. The special requirements of some academic
programs may necessitate an exception to this requirement. At
the time of the printing of this catalog, some degree programs
were in the process of requesting an exception to require fewer
than 42 units of upper-division credit. For current information,
students should consult their advisors, the department which offers
their major, or the <I>On Course</I>! Academic Program Requirements
Report for their major to determine if their degree program may
require fewer than 42 units of upper-division credit.
<P>
<B>Correspondence And Credit By Examination Credit Maximums</B>

<P>
A maximum of 60 units toward a bachelor's degree may be earned
through correspondence credit and/or credit by examination.
<P>
