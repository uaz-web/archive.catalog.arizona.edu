<B><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</B> 
<P>
As the most comprehensive academic division of The University
of Arizona, Arts and Sciences subsumes four units: Fine Arts,
Humanities, Science, and Social and Behavioral Sciences. All B.A.
and B.S. students in these four units share a single general education
program.&nbsp;

(520) 621-1301</B> 
<P>
Professional programs offered in Fine Arts educate the thinkers
and practitioners who will define the emerging standards for the
arts. The University provides a rich environment for training,
research and experimentation in the arts directed by a faculty
of practicing professionals and scholars. In Fine Arts, independent
artists and scholars revitalize their skills and generate innovative
methods and aesthetic concepts. Fine Arts also provides training
and resources based on formal tradition and cultural heritage
as a means to interpret and create in our contemporary society.
<P>
The academic commitment of the arts is to audiences as well as
artists, to community as well as students, to culture as well
as curriculum. Access to the knowledge found in the arts must
be available to all of society.

The humanities sustain the ongoing conversations of different
cultures. Humanities offers programs dedicated to literature,
literacy, language-learning and cross-cultural understanding.
Its courses promote critical and creative thinking by (1) cultivating
literacy in its many forms, especially in writing and the analysis
of various literatures; (2) opening up other languages to non-native
speakers; and (3) developing greater understanding of the histories,
varieties and transformations of different human cultures. Humanities
is composed of seven departments of language and literatures,
as well as several interdisciplinary programs, and offers degrees
in more than 13 languages. It also supports special emphases in
creative writing, English as a second language, religious studies,
comparative cultural and literary studies, and classical archaeology,
as well as public programs offered by the Poetry Center and the
Humanities Seminars.

Science conducts programs of education and research in fields
of study spanning the biological, mathematical and physical sciences.
The emphases are on teaching a fundamental understanding of scientific
knowledge, the discovery of new knowledge, the synthesis of new
understandings about the natural world and mathematics, and the
application of that knowledge to solving important problems and
to advancing society's interests.
<P>
Comprehensive educational programs in most Science departments
encompass both undergraduate and graduate education. Most departments
offer degrees at the Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral levels.
At all levels, there is emphasis on including students-undergraduate
and graduate students-as participants in ongoing research programs,
exploring the frontiers of human knowledge; highly motivated students,
who believe that they can gain from such intensive research experiences,
are strongly encouraged to participate.
<P>
Science undergraduate education seeks to graduate students fully
prepared to take on the most challenging and productive roles
at the forefront of technical industry and business, or for the
many who choose it to continue their educations in the best and
most challenging graduate programs. Science departments also offer
a comprehensive selection of introductory and advanced courses
in science and mathematics for those students needing such courses
in support of technical educations being pursued in other parts
of the University. The science faculty also teaches a large number
of specially de-signed general education courses aimed at fostering
a broad understanding of scientific knowledge and its relationship
to other human endeavors.

Social and Behavioral Sciences offers a selective suite of distinguished
educational, research and applied programs focusing on the understanding
of human beings, the groups they form, and the societies and cultures
they create. The departments and programs within Social and Behavioral
Sciences provide not only disciplinary degrees but also various
interdisciplinary majors and minors. The unit promotes fundamental
research in individual behavior, cultural expression, social organization,
theory and values as well as public and private policy. The strength
of this unit in the traditional academic disciplines is enriched
by programs extending across Social and Behavioral Sciences and
beyond its boundaries. Building on its academic expertise and
excellent teaching programs, Social and Behavioral Sciences actively
contribute to the cultural, social and economic development of
the regional and global community.

<P>
<B>3/2 Program</B> 
<P>
This is a cooperative academic plan developed by Arts and Sciences
and the College of Business, and approved by the Graduate College.
<P>
The 3/2 Program offers highly qualified Arts and Sciences students
the opportunity to earn both an undergraduate and Master of Business
Administration degree in 5 years. The student first completes
3 years of coursework, meeting general education requirements,
selected prerequisite courses, and the requirements of the major
field of study. The Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT)
is taken, and application to the 3/2 Program is made during the
second semester of the junior year. Qualified students are accepted
for the senior year with continued study in 30 units of designated
MBA courses. The 30 MBA units are used within the undergraduate
degree program as the minor, as elective units or as excess units.
Upon completion of all degree requirements, the baccalaureate
degree is awarded. Admission to the Graduate College to complete
the MBA is based upon compliance with Graduate College requirements
and procedures, and a minimum grade-point average of 3.00 in the
30 units of completed MBA classes.
<P>
Additional information is available through advisors in Arts and Sciences and in the Graduate Professional Programs
Office, College of Business.
<P>
<B>Prelaw Program</B> 
<P>
A broad liberal education is considered an excellent preparation
for a career in law. Recommended courses are those that strengthen
communication, analytical and research skills, along with courses
that provide an understanding of social, political and economic
institutions. Legal internships are available that contribute
to the development of law-related skills and insights. However,
there is not a specific prelaw curriculum. Law school deans encourage
prelaw students to choose a major that reflects their interests
and abilities, offers the functional skills necessary for a law
career or builds a foundation for a legal specialty.
<P>
Law schools accredited by the American Bar Association require
a bachelor's degree for admission. Specific criteria assessed
by law schools include: student's score on the Law School Admissions
Test (LSAT), undergraduate grade-point average, community and
college extracurricular activities, volunteer or work experience,
letters of recommendation and a student's personal statement (written
essay). The preparation process begins during the freshman year
with course selection and culminates in the fall of the senior
year with the application process.
<P>
Freshmen are encouraged to test their commitment to a legal career
and to examine all degree options before choosing a major. During
the first year of undergraduate study, students can make an appointment
with the prelaw advisor in Arts and Sciences for assistance in planning a program.
In addition, the prelaw advisor is able to answer questions about
the law school admission process, the LSAT, visits of law school
representatives and the prelaw student associations, Phi Alpha
Delta and Minority Prelaw Students Association.
<P>
In recent years, from 60 to 70 percent of the UA graduates who
applied to law school have been accepted.
<P>
<B>Prehealth Program</B> 
<P>
The Prehealth Professions Program assists students from all colleges
of the University who are interested in the fields of medicine,
dentistry, optometry and podiatry. Services are available for
all students, from entering freshmen to seniors, including graduate
students and returning students who have a degree and are completing
professional program admission requirements.
<P>
Premedicine is not a formal major. While most premeds major in
the sciences, particularly biochemistry or molecular and cellular
biology, a science major is not a prerequisite for admission to
medical school. Students are encouraged to major in any area of
interest, as medical schools are seeking applicants with a broad
liberal arts background. Non-science majors, however, are advised
to minor in a science as the nine upper division science units,
when added to the core prerequisites, will better prepare them
for medical school.
<P>
All U.S. medical, dental, osteopathy and podiatry schools require
for admission: 1 year of general biology (MCB 181-182); 1 year
of general chemistry (CHEM 103a/b and 104a/b); 1 year of organic
chemistry (CHEM 241a/b and 243a/b); and 1 year of physics (PHYS
102a/b or 104a/b and 180a/b or PHYS 110 and 116). A few of these
schools also require a semester of calculus (MATH 124 or 125a).
Schools of optometry have several additional requirements. Information
is available in the Prehealth Professions Office, Modern Languages
Building, Room 347.
<P>
When evaluating an applicant, health professions schools seriously
consider the cumulative grade-point average. The average GPA of
UA graduates accepted to medical school is 3.5; to dental and
optometry schools, 3.2; and to podiatry schools, 3.0. Improved
performance, such as a rising GPA after a poor freshman year,
are taken into consideration.
<P>
A second major factor in selection is the score acquired on the
Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), Dental Admission Test (DAT),
or the Optometry Admission Test (OAT). These exams are taken in
the spring of the junior year or in the fall of the senior year.
<P>
Clinical experience, letters of recommendation, community service,
extracurricular activities and interviews are also factors in
the selection process.
<P>
The prehealth professional advisor is available by appointment.
In addition, general information meetings are held each semester
for freshmen and sophomores so that they can be apprised of preparation
for professional school. In November, a registration meeting is
held for all juniors interested in the health professions. Following
this meeting, registered students are notified about a series
of seminars, approximately one per month, on various professional
application issues. Students are assisted in such issues as writing
their personal statements, preparing for interviews and filling
out the application forms. Applicants may request an interview
and a composite recommendation from the Prehealth Professions
Committee, composed of University faculty, staff and administrators.
The Committee recommendation, in conjunction with individual letters
solicited by the student, form the student's recommendation file.
These recommendations are sent to the schools when requested by
the student.
<P>
The prehealth professions advisor is assisted by a team of premed
peer advisors. They are seniors currently applying to health professions
schools, and are available to all students daily on a walk-in
basis.
<P>
Underrepresented minority students, including Native Americans,
Hispanics and African Americans, are actively recruited by health
professions schools. The Minority Premed Club and the Minority
Recruitment Project, sponsored by the College of Medicine, are
available, in addition to the Prehealth Professions Office, to
encourage minority applicants.

<B><A NAME="maj"></A>The Major</B> 
<P>
<I>THE MAJOR FOR HUMANITIES, SCIENCE, AND SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL
SCIENCES-</I>The undergraduate academic programs listed above
as majors and degrees under these units are open to all students.
A major is a method of organizing studies around a single discipline.
These in-depth studies provide a sense of the growth and evolution
of knowledge, its complexity and limitations, and its method of
training in critical analysis and the solving of problems. Although
the major may or may not determine one's career, it is the cornerstone
of an undergraduate degree program. It should reflect postgraduate
options and personal, career and life considerations. Each department
provides an advisor to help its majors select courses in the major
and in a minor.
<P>
<I>THE MAJOR FOR FINE ARTS-</I>Fine Arts requires students to
declare a degree program at the time of application for admission
to the University or upon entrance into Fine Arts. Students can
file a change in major at any time upon approval of the Office
of the Dean. Students choose a major advisor in the selected department
upon declaring a major. For general fine arts studies, advising
is provided in the Music Building, Room 113.
<P>
The course and total-unit requirements for majors are specified
by individual departments in the <I>Departments and Courses of
Instruction</I> section of this catalog. Course work used to satisfy
other graduation requirements cannot be used to satisfy requirements
of the major. Students must obtain a grade-point average of 2.000
or better for all work in the major.
<P>
For graduation with bachelor degrees other than the Bachelor of
Fine Arts and the Bachelor of Music degrees, students must complete
the general education requirements, a major, a minor and appropriate
electives. Bachelor of Arts degrees are offered with majors in
art history, media arts, music and theatre arts.
<P>
For graduation with Bachelor of Fine Arts and Bachelor of Music
degrees, students must complete the general education requirements,
a major and appropriate electives. Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees
are offered with majors in studio art, art education, dance, theatre
production, theatre education, musical theatre and general fine
arts studies; Bachelor of Music degrees are offered with majors
in performance, music education, composition and jazz studies.
For B.F.A. and B.M. degrees, at least 45 general academic units
must be taken outside the major department. The general education
requirements are counted toward these 45 outside units. Students
majoring in art education, theatre education or music education
must complete at least 56 units applicable to the degree with
a grade-point average of 2.500 or better, and must obtain written
permission from the Office of Student Services, College of Education,
before being admitted to certain professional education courses.
(See the<I> College of Education</I> section of this catalog for
additional details.)
<P>
The B.F.A. degree with a major in general fine arts studies combines
general education requirements with concentrated study and participation
in selected fine arts fields. For information regarding the specific
requirements for this major, please refer to the <I>General Education</I>
section below. Students pursuing this degree must take at least
45 units outside Fine Arts.
<P>
Fine Arts students are encouraged to participate in both on-campus
and nondepartmental, off-campus productions and performances.
Participation cannot conflict, however, with commitments already
made to departmental programs and to student colleagues in those
programs. When such conflicts are imminent, students are responsible
for consulting in advance with their department head or director.
<P>
<I>THE MAJOR FOR ARTS AND SCIENCES-</I>The Interdisciplinary Studies
major (IDS) is offered within Arts and Sciences for the Bachelor
of Arts degree. It permits a student to combine three disciplines
into a coherent and intellectually challenging major. Designing
the major requires that the student: (1) construct the program
of study with the aid of an Arts and Sciences advisor and a committee constructed
from a faculty member in each of the three disciplines chosen;
(2) prepare a written proposal; and (3) have the final proposal
and program accepted by the committee. Each change in proposal
must also be approved by the faculty committee and the Arts and Sciences advisor.
<P>
Requirements include:
<P>
1. All general education requirements
<P>
2. 24 units within each of three subject areas
<P>
3. 125 total units for the B.A. Degree
<P>
4. 42 upper-division units
<P>
5. 12 upper-division units in each subject area
<P>
6. 90 units in Arts and Sciences courses
<P>
7. 12 University units in each subject area
<P>
8. A 2.0 GPA in each subject area and cumulatively
<P>
Entry to the interdisciplinary studies major follows the completion
of 30 units. Application for the degree must be filed by no later
than the end of the fourth week of the semester preceding the
semester of graduation. For the purpose of this degree, an August
graduation will be treated as a May graduation.
<P>
Subject areas I and II must be in a single programs or majors
in which a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree is
offered, or in the structured program of an academic committee
within one of the four units in Arts and Sciences (i.e. Fine Arts,
Humanities, Science and Social and Behavioral Sciences).
<P>
Subject area III may include courses from these four units or
from another UA college. Courses in area III must be selected
from no more than two related academic disciplines (divided equally),
or from an approved combination of courses united by a common
theme. In a foreign language, only upper division course work
may be used in split area III program. Certain courses may not
be used in any IDS area: freshman composition, courses below MATH
124, military or naval science, activity courses in exercise and
sport sciences and first year courses in foreign languages and
American Sign Language. Reminder: a maximum of 10 units of general
education coursework can be used to fulfill all other graduation
requirements (i.e., major, minor, IDS subject areas).
<P>
<I>DOUBLE MAJOR</I>-A student may create a double major by satisfying
all of the requirements for the major in two departments within
Arts and Sciences. Both majors must lead to the same degree-B.A.,
B.S., B.F.A. or B.M. A minor will be allowed. A double major is
available within the Department of English in English and creative
writing. It is essential to maintain contact with the advisor
in each department to ensure that all requirements are being met.
Both majors are declared on the Change of Major form and when
filing for degree candidacy. The minimum units required for graduation
are 125, with at least 15 units in each major taken as University
Credit course work. The student must earn whatever number of units
is required by a selected major. Those students interested in
the double major with a B.A. or B.S. degree should meet with an
advisor in Arts and Sciences; those students interested
in the double major with a B.F.A or B.M. degree should go to the
Fine Arts Dean's office.
<P>
<B><A NAME="min"></A>The Minor</B> 
<P>
The Minor for B.A. and B.S. Programs-A 20-unit minor is required
in Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degree programs. Exceptions
are made for a double major, the interdisciplinary studies major,
the Bachelor of Arts with a major in Latin American studies, and
the Bachelor of Science in Geosciences. Most departments list
suggested core courses for a minor. Transfer students may discuss
with the major advisor use of prior coursework for the minor.
<P>
Some departments permit a split minor (a minimum of 8 units in
one department and 12 units in another department) or a thematic
minor. The thematic minor is developed around a theme identified
by the student, using courses from three or more disciplines.
A thematic minor form
must be submitted at the time of application for degree certification.
<P>
Requirements for a minor: (1) at least 20 units, and (2) at least
nine units of upper-division University Credit (except for a Japanese
language minor, when the student is not using the language to
satisfy the second language requirement in gen-eral education.
See the Department of East Asian Studies for information.) Excluded
from the minor: freshman composition, courses below Math 124,
military aerospace studies, military or naval science, activity
courses in exercise and sports science, and first-year courses
in foreign language and Ameri-can Sign Language that are also
used to satisfy the second language requirement in general education.
Reminder: a maximum of 10 units of general education coursework
can be used to fulfill all other graduation requirements (i.e.,
major, minor, IDS subject areas).
<P>
<I>THE MINOR FOR FINE ARTS-</I>The minor complements the major
area of study and is an essential component of the bachelor of
arts degree programs in Fine Arts. The required 20-unit minimum
minor usually is completed in a department related to the major.
The minor must be approved by the major advisor, who also advises
the student in the minor area of study. Minors are structured
by some departments; information can be found in the departmental
listings in this catalog and by contacting the major advisor.
In general, completion of the minor can be accomplished in one
of the following ways:
<P>
1. Twenty units in one department;
<P>
2. A split minor of work done in two departments, with at least
8 units in one and 12 units in the other;
<P>
3. A fine arts minor, composed of a broad survey of courses outside
of the major department, which must include 6 to 9 units from
three of the following departments: art, dance, media arts, music,
theatre arts;
<P>
4. A teaching minor for education majors (specific requirements
described in the departmental sections of this catalog).
<P>
Course work used to satisfy other graduation requirements cannot
be applied to the requirements of the minor.
<P>
<B>Fine Arts Studies</B> 
<P>
The fine arts studies major, offered by Fine Arts for the Bachelor
of Fine Arts degree, combines general education requirements with
concentrated study and participation in selected fine arts fields.
For information regarding the specific requirements for this major,
please refer to <I>General Education</I> section below.
<P>
<B>Second Degree</B> 
<P>
A second degree may be earned (e.g., B.A. and B.S.) by completing
no fewer than 30 units in addition to the units required for the
first degree, and meeting all general education and major requirements
for the second degree.
<P>
Those students interested in a second degree that is a B.A. or
B.S. should meet with an advisor in Arts and Sciences.
Those students interested in a second degree that is a B.F.A.
or B.M should meet with an advisor in the Fine Arts Dean's office.
<P>
<B><A NAME="gen"></A>GENERAL EDUCATION</B> 
<P>
<B>B.A. and B.S. General Education Requirements</B> 
<P>
The General Education Program for B.A. and B.S. students in Arts
and Sciences is designed to afford students the opportunity to
learn how different disciplines define, acquire and organize knowledge;
this is accomplished by the program's breadth, involving courses
ranging from physics to poetry. The program is intended, as well,
to enhance understanding of the reciprocal influences of Western
and non-Western cultures, so the tradition and cultures requirement
lies at the heart of general education. In addition, the general
education courses are meant to develop analytic, synthetic, linguistic
and computational skills useful for lifelong learning; this is
the motivation behind the proficiency segment of the program.
Finally, the program is constructed to provide a common foundation
for wide ranging dialogue with peers, and to encourage personal
qualities, such as a critical and inquiring attitude, an appreciation
of complexity and ambiguity, a tolerance for and empathy with
persons of different backgrounds or values, and a deepened sense
of self so students will be able to respond more fully and effectively
to an increasingly complex world.
<P>
The following information, under the title <I>Booklink,</I> is
available for purchase in the ASUA Bookstore. An addendum to <I>Booklink</I>,
which lists courses approved after the catalog is printed, is
included in <I>Booklink</I> or is independently available in Arts and Sciences. <I>Booklink</I> is also supplemented
by <I>Booklink Supplement</I>, which provides a detailed description
of all general education courses, and by a newsletter produced
every semester that lists the courses offered that semester. <I>Booklink
Supplement</I> can be purchased at the ASUA Bookstore; the newsletter
is free and can be picked up in Arts and Sciences.
<P>
The requirements consist of two parts. You must: (1) demonstrate
basic proficiency in English composition, mathematics and a second
language; and (2) complete course requirements in four study areas
- Traditions and Cultures; Biological and Physical Sciences; Individuals,
Societies and Institutions; and Arts and Literature.<HR>

</Pre>
<I>*Fourth-semester proficiency is required. For most languages,
this equals 16 units of coursework; for some languages, this equals
as many as 20 units. It is possible for a student who fulfills
the language requirement by examination to have no University
of Arizona units in a second language.</I> 
<P>
In addition, please note:
<P>
A course satisfying a general education requirement must be taken
for a grade.
<P>
Any course accepted for general education, including SER 370a-b
and 431a-b, counts towards the minimum 90 units required in Arts
and Sciences for all B.A. or B.S. students.
<P>
A maximum of 10 units of general education coursework can be used
to fulfill all other graduation requirements (i.e., major, minor,
IDS subject areas).
<P>
I. BASIC PROFICIENCIES
<P>
Courses included in the Basic Proficiency group will ensure that
you acquire intellectual tools and skills fundamental both to
University study and to successful daily living. Effective use
of written English, a command of mathematical theory and practice
adequate to contemporary life, and a working knowledge of a second
language involve not only vital skills, but constitute, in and
of themselves, rigorous intellectual endeavors.
<P>
Mastery of them is the foundation for the General Education Program;
therefore students should arrange to complete the basic proficiencies
as early as possible. The composition and mathematics requirements
should be satisfied during the first year of an undergraduate
program. The second language requirement should be begun no later
than the first year and completed no later than the end of the
second year.
<P>
The student must take and abide by the results of any mandatory
examinations (placement-proficiency) given by the appropriate
department prior to enrollment in any of the proficiency courses.
In addition, the student may satisfy any of the three proficiency
requirements by any examinations authorized by the departments
for these courses.
<P>
A. English Composition
<P>
All freshmen must enroll in one of the following three sequences:
<P>
1.English 100 (exposition, review of syntax and usage),<BR>
English 101 (exposition, emphasis on essays) and<BR>
English 102 (critical papers on selected subjects);
<P>
2. English 101 and English 102;
<P>
3. English 103H (honors) and English 104H (honors).
<P>
Placement is based on scores resulting from the UA Freshman Composition
Placement Exam, and the English section of the ACT or the Test
of Standard Written English portion of the SAT.
<P>
B. Mathematics <BR>
College Algebra (MATH 117R or 117S), or any three-unit Mathematics
course numbered above 117R or 117S is required of all students.
Entry-level mathematics students will be advised to choose one
of three strands according to their interests, preparation and
intended major. The three strands are:
<P>
G (General Knowledge): This strand involves a general understanding
and appreciation of how mathematics is used to solve problems
in everyday life, as for example, the mathematics of voting and
elections or of networks and paths.
<P>
M (Moderate Knowledge): This strand involves reasonable facility
with algebra and algebraic functions, graphs and simple modeling.
<P>
S (Substantial Knowledge): This strand involves skill and facility
with calculus.
<P>
All strands presume that students will have completed the high
school mathematics required for entry to the University.
<P>
Choice of a strand entails certain course choices. The G-strand
includes a single class - MATH 122 (Mathematics in Modern Society).
NOTE: This choice does not prepare a student for any further mathematically-based
work; it is a terminal course. The S-strand begins at one of two
calculus I options - MATH 124 (Calculus with Applications) or
MATH 125a (Calculus). Students then may continue on to 125b, 223
or beyond. Those who are not ready to start the S-strand will
be required to take prepatory work. The M-strand is for students
who require mathematical facility at the level of at least MATH
117S or R (College Algebra) or MATH 121 (Collegiate Algebra).
Further mathematical work may include MATH 119 (Finite Mathematics),
MATH 123 (Elements of Calculus), or a statistics class from outside
the Mathematics Department.
<P>
Each major will indicate the mathematics strand that is most appropriate
for their students. Because the S-strand presumes the M-strand
and the M-strand presumes the G-strand, students will retain the
most flexibility in their major choice by aiming for the most
mathematic knowledge. A student who chooses to meet the general
education mathematics requirement with the G-strand, for instance,
will have the most restricted set of major choices available
<P>
The Math Readiness Test is required of all students prior to enrolling
in any math course numbered below 125b. Test scores are valid
for one year. (See <I>Academic Policies and Grad-uation Requirements.</I>)
<P>
C. Second Language
<P>
All students must be proficient in a second language at the fourth
semester level. You may demonstrate proficiency in one of the
following ways.
<P>
1. Successful completion of a fourth semester course taught in
the language;
<P>
2. Successful completion of the second semester of an intensive
language course;
<P>
3. Through an examination administered by the appropriate UA language
unit.
<P>
Students whose first language is not English may satisfy this
requirement by examination in that language. They may not, however,
receive University Credit for their proficiency. A student who
is interested in demonstrating native proficiency should contact Arts and
Sciences for advice as to how to proceed.
<P>
American Sign Language satisfies the second language requirement.
The sign language course sequence includes SER 370a, 370b, 431a
and 431b.
<P>
Transfer credit is allowed only for courses taken at the college
level (as defined by the specific department). Arts and Sciences
departments may require or recommend specific languages in support
of their major or preferred minor.
<P>
The composition and mathematics requirements should be satisfied
during the first year of an undergraduate program. The second
language requirement should be begun as well during the first
year.
<P>
II. STUDY AREAS
<P>
The Study Area courses encourage the investigation of relations
among and between disciplines. In seeking to identify similarities
and differences in subject matter, methods, aims and results of
the various approaches to knowledge, the student will explore
the extent to which different modes and forms of knowledge can
be integrated, and the ways in which they resist integration.
All students should also be able to better understand the segregative
boundaries that exist in human society, particularly those that
have been maintained arbitrarily on the basis of gender, class,
race or ethnic identity. Finally, courses listed among the Study
Areas are designed to introduce and epitomize their respective
disciplines, so as to enable the student to make informed decisions
about majors and careers.
<P>
All Study Area courses are expected to include a writing component.
Writing in general education courses places students in an active
relationship with the body of facts, ideas and theories presented
in courses and helps them develop a critical appreciation of the
ways knowledge is acquired and used. Writing also develops the
attitudes of mind essential to the wise and humane use of knowledge
and intellectual skills: respect for evidence, reason and the
contingent nature of truth; open-mindedness; motivation, involving
personal characteristics such as initiative, curiosity and an
appetite for learning; and the willingness to pursue a line of
inquiry to its logical conclusion. Each department develops the
specific purposes and kinds of writing required in their general
education courses, so that students understand the standard features
of strong writing across disciplines and the aspects of writing
that vary according to discipline. However, midterm and final
examinations are not deemed sufficient for this requirement, even
when they include essay questions. In science courses lab reports
may be an essential skill, while students in the performing arts
may be expected to write critiques of performances. Students in
humanities or social science may be expected to write critical
and theoretical essays. Most important is that the writing assignments
are relevant to the discipline and appropriate to the course level.
<P>
These requirements may be fulfilled during any semester of the
undergraduate years. However, the Biological and Physical Science
requirement should be completed as soon as possible after establishing
mathematical competency, and the majority of Traditions and Cultures
courses are aimed at lower division students.
<P>
At least one course in a student's Study Area courses must focus
systematically on gender, class, race or ethnicity. Such courses
are marked with an asterisk (*).
<P>
Transfer credit may be allowed for courses in which equivalency
has been established. (See also <I>Transfer Students</I> and <I>General
Education</I> below.)
<P>
A. Traditions and Cultures
<P>
Fundamental to this study area is the awareness that our place
in the world is determined by two distinct forces. We are historical
beings, shaped by the experience and acts of our predecessors;
in turn we shape the lives of those who follow us. But no simple
connection binds us to the past, as we are also profoundly affected
by the cultures coexisting with our own.
<P>
The internal organization of this Study Area is intended to reinforce
the assumption of these two forces. You must take a total of nine
units (three courses): three units (one course) from List 1 and
a six-unit sequence from List 2. Studied in conjunction, these
two course sets provide a greater understanding of the reciprocal
influences of Western and Non-Western cultural traditions.

This Study Area will provide the student with the vocabulary and
the facts needed to understand major scientific principles. In
addition, it will show how data are collected to test hypotheses,
how conclusions from these data can be used to make predictions,
construct models, or formulate general theories, and what part
skepticism and knowledge of limits play in the interpretation
and acceptance of new ideas.
<P>
This requirement is to be satisfied by two courses, four units
each, which include laboratory work. (In addition to traditional
laboratories, courses involving field trips and data analysis/discussion
sessions may be considered lab experiences.) Students are strongly
encouraged to take either one two-semester sequence in the biological
sciences (which includes ecology and evolutionary biology, microbiology,
molecular and cellular biology) or one two-semester sequence in
the physical sciences (which includes astronomy, atmospheric sciences,
chemistry, GEOG 103a and 104a, geosciences, hydrology and water
resources, physics, planetary sciences, soil and water science).

C. Individuals, Societies and Institutions
<P>
Courses in this Study Area afford students an opportunity to examine
systematically individual and collective action, and to explore
the basic concepts and theories used in analysis of personal,
social, cultural, political, economic, philosophical, religious
and scientific issues. As a result, they understand more clearly
issues of self-identity, social difference, and social status,
the role of science in society and the effects of major institutions
on individual experiences. This requirement is to be met by taking
three three-unit courses, offered in at least two different departments.

POLICIES
<P>
<B><A NAME="cha"></A>Change of Major</B> 
<P>
Fine Arts majors should consult an advisor in the Office of the
Dean of Fine Arts Music Building, Room 113 or the advisor in the
specific department.
<P>
To change from a major in Humanities, Science or Social and Behavioral
Science to another within the same three units, the student must
fill out a declaration of major form from Arts and Sciences, Modern Languages Building, Room 347. Approval for the
change must be obtained first from the new department by the student
before the form is turned in to Arts and Sciences.
To declare an Interdisciplinary Studies Major, go to Arts and Sciences for instructions regarding special procedures.
<P>
The change of major is effective at the beginning of the next
semester.
<P>
<B><A NAME="cou"></A>Course Load</B> 
<P>
The maximum course load is 19 units of credit per semester. All
courses, including those taken for credit, audit, by correspondence
or at another academic institution are counted in determining
the maximum academic load in Humanities, Science, and Social and
Behavioral Science. Students in these units who wish to register
for more than 19 hours must have a grade-point average of at least
3.0 and must secure permission from the Assistant Dean of Arts and Sciences. In Fine Arts, correspondence courses
are not counted in the 19-unit maximum.
<P>
<B><A NAME="app"></A>Grade Appeal Procedures</B> 
<P>
Grade appeals in Fine Arts, Humanities, Science, and Social and
Behavioral Sciences are heard in the offices of the respective
deans.
<P>
<B><A NAME="tra"></A>Transfer Students - General Information</B>

<P>
The Office of Admissions and New Student Enrollment (in the Nugent
Building) reviews the official transcript to determine course
transfer credits. The evaluator may assign a transfer course to
a discipline, or may assign a direct course equivalency for a
course from an Arizona community college. Entering transfer students
who wish to determine the application of courses to the general
education program should see an advisor in Arts and Sciences.
<P>
The evaluation of transfer course work in the major and minor
disciplines is done by the major advisor. Except for students
in Fine Arts, all students must declare a major area of study
at the 55-unit level. Students who transfer 55 units or more may
remain as undeclared for one semester following admission.
<P>
For non-Fine Arts students, a copy of the transcript from the
Office of Admissions is required for evaluations. Advisors will
not evaluate the application of courses to the degree program
without a university transcript evaluation. In Fine Arts, advisors
use the computerized evaluation. However, students must have previously
submitted their transfer transcripts to the Office of Admissions.
<P>
Students are urged to participate in the academic orientations
offered by the college during the summer and at the beginning
of each semester. Special sessions offer the transfer student
an evaluation of the transcript, explanation of the requirements
and meaning of the General Education Program, materials that cover
the degree options, a list of faculty advisors and specific information
about the special and preprofessional programs.
<P>
<B>Transfer Students from Arizona Community Colleges</B> 
<P>
The University of Arizona has prepared transfer guides that will
help community college students select courses to satisfy the
General Education requirements. These transfer guides are available
at every community college in the student advising offices. Students
should work closely with the community college advisors in planning
their curriculum, in order to make the smoothest possible transition
to the University.
<P>
In addition, the Arizona community colleges and the Arizona universities
have entered into an agreement regarding the application of transfer
units toward General Education. This agreement is called the Transfer
General Education Core Curriculum (TGECC).
<P>
To complete a degree program efficiently, students should select
courses to meet the Transfer General Education Core Curriculum
requirements that will also fulfill program requirements in the
college and major they intend to pursue upon transfer (see &quot;Transfer
General Education Core Curriculum [TGECC]&quot;) under <I>Admission
and Registration </I>section). Community college students transferring
to The University of Arizona from an Arizona community college
will satisfy the general education requirements in Arts and Sciences
upon completion of the following college requirements.
<P>
I. Arts and Sciences strongly recommends, for all transfer students
with a B.A. or B. S. degree objective, that 6 units of the Arts
and Humanities subject area in the transfer core be devoted to
a Western civilization sequence.
<P>
II. Arts and Sciences will require of all transfer students with
a B.A. or B.S. degree objective, as part of the college portion
of the general education requirements:- proficiency in a second
language at the fourth semester level;- a course in non-Western
civilization;<BR>
- a course in literature.The requirement for a course in non-Western
civilization can be met within the transfer core curriculum as
the required three units of coursework emphasizing global/international
awareness or historical awareness. Should this requirement in
the transfer core curriculum not be met with a non-Western course,
the student will be required to take an upper-division course
in non-Western civilization at The University of Arizona (See
List 1, Study Area A for the possibilities). The requirement for
a course in literature can be met within the transfer core curriculum
as one of the six units of options. Should the student not choose
a literature course as an option, the student will be required
to take an upper division course in literature at The University
of Arizona. (See the Literature list, Study Area D for the possibilities.)
