<B>COLLEGE OF NURSING</B>
<P>
<B><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</B>
<P>
The College of Nursing offers a professional program leading to
the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree (B.S.N.) and graduate
programs leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy
degrees with a major in nursing. The B.S.N. and graduate curriculum
are currently under review. Prospective students should consult
the College of Nursing for current information. For information
regarding graduate study, please see the Graduate Catalog.
<P>
The College of Nursing also offers a B.S.N. pathway for registered
nurses who graduated from associate degree or diploma nursing
programs and an accelerated B.S.N. pathway for superior students
who are college graduates holding a baccalaureate or higher degree
in a non-nursing field.
<P>
The program which leads to the B.S.N. degree prepares the graduate
to begin practice as a professional nurse, and to undertake graduate
study in nursing. The curriculum is composed of prenursing courses,
which are taken in Arts and Sciences, followed by the professional
nursing major. After having completed the pre-nursing phase of
the program, students are admitted selectively to the College
of Nursing to begin the nursing major in fall or spring. A minimum
of 30 units of the nursing major must be University Credit course
work. Minor programs of study are available for undergraduates.
Completion of a minor is not required for graduation from the
College of Nursing. A minimum of 18 units of course work must
be completed with a grade point average of 2.00 or better to successfully
complete a minor. A minimum of 12 units must be upper-division
course work. Selection of a minor should be made in consultation
with a College of Nursing advisor.
<P>
Nursing students are preparing for a profession which is exacting
and in which they must take responsibility for the lives and well-being
of others. Applicants must be in good physical and mental health;
otherwise, they may be denied admission or, once admitted, recommended
for withdrawal.
<P>
The college is accredited by the National League for Nursing and
approved by the Arizona State Board of Nursing. Upon recommendation
of the faculty, the graduates will be admitted to the licensing
examination administered by the State Board of Nursing.
<P>
<B><A NAME="req"></A>REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P>
Any entering freshman who meets University admission requirements
as described in the <I>Admission to the University </I>section
of this catalog may be admitted to the Arts and Sciences for the
pre-nursing portion of the program.
<P>
Transfer students must meet the same University admission requirements.
They may complete all freshman and sophomore general education
requirements as listed in the nursing program at another college
or university, or may present a combination of transfer and University
of Arizona courses for consideration for admission to the nursing
major. Before a decision to transfer to The University of Arizona
is made, prospective transfer students are strongly advised to
have their previous course work evaluated by the College of Nursing.
<P>
There is a selection process before any student can be accepted
into the College of Nursing for the professional nursing courses.
To be considered for admission to the baccalaureate program, a
student must have: removed any high school deficiencies; completed
designated prerequisites; earned a 2.750 grade-point average in
designated prerequisites; and earned a cumulative grade-point
average of 2.750.
<P>
Completion of prerequisite courses with a 2.750 average does not
assure a student of admission to the professional nursing courses.
The number of applicants admitted to the professional courses
is limited by the resources of the college. A grade-point average
above 3.00 is normally required.
<P>
All transfer students must have a minimum 2.750 average on all
freshman and sophomore courses for both University of Arizona
and transfer credits for consideration for admission to the college.
Students who have done well at other nursing schools may be permitted
to transfer to The University of Arizona. A letter from the dean
or director of the nursing school stating that the applicant is
in good standing and eligible to continue nursing studies at that
institution is required. Admission criteria for the College of
Nursing are periodically reviewed. Consult with the College of
Nursing for current information.
<P>
Students are required to take the University of Arizona Writing-Proficiency
Examination before starting their classes in the College of Nursing.
Students who have an unsatisfactory rating on the examination
will be required to complete developmental work acceptable to
the College of Nursing.
<P>
All students entering the College of Nursing are required to have
basic computer knowledge, obtained in high school, computer store,
university courses, or self-taught.
<P>
Since enrollment in the college is limited, completion of freshman
courses by entering freshmen or transfer students with the required
grade-point average does not assure the student of admission to
the major. Once admitted to the major, the student must be full
time, attending five consecutive semesters. During these semesters
the student must be enrolled for all required courses.
<P>
Students seeking acceptance to the College of Nursing for a fall
semester need to file the special application form, obtained directly
from the college, by December 1 of the previous year in which
they desire to enter and can expect to hear of their status in
early April. Students planning to enter the college in a spring
semester must file this application by July 1 of the previous
year and can expect a response regarding acceptance in early October.
The College of Nursing does not maintain a waiting list. Students
wishing to reapply must contact the College of Nursing regarding
reapplication.
<P>
In addition to these requirements, registered nurses from diploma
or associate degree schools of nursing must hold a current, valid
Arizona license to practice nursing. For these applicants, acceptance
of transfer credits and the establishment of credit by examination
will be considered on an individual basis. (See also <I>&quot;Special
Examination for Credit&quot; </I>section of this catalog.)
<P>
Since clinical laboratories are in a variety of community settings,
all students in the clinical nursing courses are required to provide
their own transportation to the areas where they are assigned
for patient-care experience.
<P>
A candidate for the degree of B.S.N. must fulfill the requirements
both in number and kind of units as outlined in the catalog under
which the student has chosen to graduate. The graduation average
must be 2.000 or better, with an average of 2.000 or better for
all work undertaken in the major field at The University of Arizona
(See also <I>Graduation Requirements</I> section of this catalog.)
<P>
Graduation from the College of Nursing is not the sole criterion
for obtaining a license to practice nursing in Arizona. Licensing
requirements are the exclusive responsibility of the State Board
of Nursing. Graduates must satisfy licensure requirements independently
of degree requirements.
<P>
<B>Grading Policy for Nursing Courses</B> 
<P>
The grade of &quot;D&quot; is unacceptable for courses in the
nursing major, including pre-nursing courses, as it does not reflect
acceptable performance. Pre-nursing students who do not complete
a required course(s) with a grade &quot;C&quot; or better must
repeat the course. Students already enrolled in the College of
Nursing who do not complete a required course(s) with a grade
&quot;C&quot; or better, are not eligible to progress in the professional
nursing major. The student may be permitted to repeat the course
for credit.
