<P>
<B><A NAME="gen"></A>General Education</B> 
<P>
The College of Education is an upper-division college, that is,
it provides undergraduates with course work at the junior and
senior level only. Undergraduates normally apply for admission
to the college at the end of their sophomore year, after two years
at a two or four-year institution as pre-education majors. If
enrolled at The University of Arizona, pre-education students
are administratively housed in Arts and Sciences; however, pre-education
majors are advised in the Office of Student and Career Services
in the College of Education. Upon formal admission to the College,
students are assisted by a faculty advisor in the department appropriate
to their chosen major assisted by the Office of Student and Career
Services.
<P>
Pre-education students fulfill, with a few exceptions, the same
general education requirements as in Arts and Sciences. Therefore,
pre-education students should refer to the section in this catalog
on General Education in Arts and Sciences to plan their freshman
and sophomore course work.
<P>
<I>REFINEMENTS TO GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS</I> 
<P>
Undergraduate students in the College of Education select a major
in either elementary education, secondary education, or special
education and rehabilitation. Students should follow the course
recommendations below according to the major selected. All students
intending to seek admission to the College of Education are strongly
encouraged to consult an academic advisor in the Office of Student
and Career Services early in their college career.
<P>
<B>Elementary Education</B> 
<P>
<I>MATHEMATICS</I> 
<P>
Math 117 (College Algebra) or Math 122 (Math in Modern Society)
or higher level math courses, are prerequisites to Math 301 (Understanding
Elementary Math); which is a prerequisite to the methods of the
teaching of math.
<P>
<I>BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES</I> 
<P>
Select one four-unit laboratory science from two of the following
areas:
<P>
Life Science: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology,
Molecular and Cellular Biology, Plant Science or Botany
<P>
Earth Science: Astronomy, Atmospheric Science, Geography and Regional
Development, Geosciences, Planetary Sciences, Soil and Water Sciences,
or Hydrology and Water Resources
<P>
Physical Science: Chemistry or Physics
<P>
<I>INDIVIDUALS, SOCIETIES, AND INSTITUTIONS</I> 
<P>
The College of Education requires course work or examinations
in U.S. and Arizona constitutions. This requirement may be met
in one of three ways:
<P>
POL 102, American National Government (U.S. constitution) and
POL 130, American State and Local Government (Arizona constitution)
<P>
OR
<P>
Successful completion of the two state examinations in U.S. and
Arizona constitutions (The Office of Student and Career Services
has information on these examinations).
<P>
OR
<P>
Successful completion of Political Science 112 (National and State
constitutions) transferred from Pima Community College.
<P>
Completion of POL 102 and POL 130 will also meet part of the ISI
requirement for College of Education students. Students who have
not met this requirement will not graduate or be eligible for
teacher certification until this requirement has been met.
<P>
<I>ARTS AND LITERATURE</I> 
<P>
A list of approved courses for the Fine Arts component of this
requirement is available in the Office of Student and Career Services.
<P>
<I>SECOND LANGUAGE</I> 
<P>
Any language is acceptable. However, due to the ethnic composition
of Arizona schools, the College of Education shows preference
to students with competency in Spanish or other languages of the
Southwest.
<P>
<B>Secondary Education</B> 
<P>
<I>MATHEMATICS</I> 
<P>
The math requirements for students at the secondary level vary
depending upon the major and minor chosen. Majors or minors in
the sciences or math require substantial knowledge (calculus and
higher) in math. Other majors and minors may only require a general
knowledge of math (MATH 122). Students should check with the Office
of Student and Career Services or the respective academic department
for the math sequence best suited to their degree objective.
<P>
<I>INDIVIDUALS, SOCIETIES, AND INSTITUTIONS</I> 
<P>
See Elementary refinements above.
<P>
<I>SECOND LANGUAGE</I> 
<P>
See Elementary refinements above.
<P>
<B>Special Education and Rehabilitation</B> 
<P>
<I>MATHEMATICS </I>
<P>
The general rehabilitation emphasis in Special Education and Rehabilitation
requires knowledge of math in algebra and statistics and measurement.
The general education requirement for math may be met with college
algebra (MATH 117 or MATH 121) or higher. The major emphasis in
Deaf Studies requires only a general knowledge in math; MATH 122
will meet the general education requirement for math for students
in this area.
<P>
<I>BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES</I> 
<P>
Students intending to major in either program in SER must take
EXSS 201 and 202 (4 units each), &quot;Human Anatomy and Physiology&quot;.
This eight-unit sequence satisfies the University requirement
for biological and physical sciences. Students specializing in
SER Deaf Studies may take SPH 260, &quot;Speech Science&quot;
(4) and SPH 280, &quot;Hearing Science&quot; (4) to meet their
science requirement.
<P>
<I>INDIVIDUALS, SOCIETIES, AND INSTITUTIONS</I> 
<P>
All SER majors must take at least one course in general psychology.
PSYCH 101, &quot;Introduction to Psychology&quot; will satisfy
part of the General Education requirements under ISI.
<P>
<I>SECOND LANGUAGE</I> 
<P>
For students seeking the SER major with the emphasis in General
Rehabilitation, American Sign Language is acceptable, as well
as any other second language approved by the Uni-versity. American
Sign Language is required for students seeking the Deaf Studies
specialization.
<P>
<B><A NAME="und"></A>Undergraduate Majors</B> 
<P>
At the undergraduate level, students select either a major administered
within the College of Education or a subject area teaching major
administered through another academic department. Majors within
the College of Education are available in elementary education
and special education &amp; rehabilitation. At the time of catalog
production, the major in early childhood education was under review.
<P>
A teaching major is defined as the secondary school academic subject
area in which the student plans to teach. Teaching majors are
administered through the relevant academic departments in cooperation
with the College of Education, which is responsible for providing
the necessary professional education course work. Subject area
course requirements for prospective teachers will be found under
the appropriate academic department in the <I>Departments and
Courses of Instruction</I> section of this catalog. For information
on the professional education requirements, consult an academic
advisor in the Office of Student and Career Services.
<P>
The Bachelor of Science in Education degree is awarded for a major
in special education and rehabilitation (including a specialty
in interpreting for the deaf) and for teaching majors in mathematics
or any of the physical sciences. The Bachelor of Arts in Education
degree is awarded for majors in elementary education, or any teaching
major area other than mathematics or any of the physical sciences.
See &quot;Majors and Minors for Secondary School Teaching&quot;in
this section for a list of available teaching majors.
<P>
<B><A NAME="min"></A>Undergraduate Minors</B> 
<P>
At the secondary level (grades 7-12), most majors will require
a teaching minor in a second field of specialization. Course requirements
for those teaching minors will be listed under the relevant academic
department in the <I>Departments and Courses of Instruction</I>
section of this catalog. Three particular teaching majors are
sufficiently comprehensive as to require no additional minor subject
(see &quot;Majors Requiring No Minor&quot;).
<P>
Students majoring in Elementary Education are required to complete
an academic concentration of at least eighteen (18) units, chosen
in consultation with an academic advisor in the Office of Student
and Career Services. Areas for the academic concentration are
limited to English, fine arts, foreign languages, math, sciences,
social sciences, and environmental education.
<P>
Majors in Special Education and Rehabilitation require a minor
field chosen from anthropology, psychology or sociology. Other
areas may be approved and should be selected in consultation with
an academic advisor in the Office of Student and Career Services
with approval of the Department of Special Education and Rehabilitation.
<P>
There is also a non-teaching minor in Special Education and Rehabilitation
offered to persons who wish to explore the field as an adjunct
to majors outside the College of Education. Students interested
in this minor should consult with an academic advisor in the Office
of Student and Career Services or the Department of Special Education
and Rehabilitation (see Undergraduate Programs section).
<P>
<B>Selection of Majors and Minors</B> 
<P>
Majors and minors should be selected in consultation with a College
of Education advisor as early in the undergraduate career as possible,
and no later than the junior year. Major subjects may be changed
at the beginning of any semester. However, if a change of major
or minor field is made late in the program, an additional semester
or more may be necessary to complete the required course work.
<P>
Teaching majors and minors should be selected from the following
lists of subjects commonly taught in high schools in most states.
With the exception of the three majors that require no minors,
all subject areas available as teaching majors may also be chosen
as teaching minors; additional subject areas are available as
minors only.

<P>
<B><A NAME="tea"></A>TEACHING MAJORS FOR DEGREES OUTSIDE THE COLLEGE
OF EDUCATION</B> 
<P>
Three academic units outside the College of Education offer programs
for training teachers in their particular disciplines. These majors
will earn degrees specific to those units, rather than College
of Education degrees. A major in art education, for example, offered
by Arts and Sciences, Fine Arts, will earn a Bachelor of Fine
Arts; similarly, a major in agricultural education, offered by
the College Agriculture, will earn a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture.
<P>
The following teaching majors and degrees are available outside
the College of Education.
<P>
Agricultural Education (B.S.Ag.) College of Agriculture
<P>
Art Education (B.F.A.) Arts and Sciences
<P>
Health Education (B.S.H.S.) School of Health-Related Professions
<P>

<P>
<B><A NAME="adm"></A>ADMISSIONS</B> 
<P>
Formal admission to the College of Education is required of all
undergraduate students who wish to pursue a major for a College
of Education degree as well as for students who wish to enroll
in restricted professional education courses for the purpose of
earning a teaching certificate. Undergraduate students normally
apply for admission at the end of their sophomore year. Persons
who have previously earned a bachelor's degree from a regionally
accredited institution and are interested in obtaining a State
of Arizona teaching certificate apply for admission in the same
way as undergraduate students. Graduate students who have already
been admitted to a graduate degree program in the University must
also apply for admission to College of Education programs.

Students who are judged eligible are then evaluated by four additional
criteria:
<P>
1. Academic achievement, as indicated by grade point average and
scores on required and optional standardized tests.
<P>
2. Language proficiency, in English and in other languages common
to Arizona and the American Southwest, as indicated by the applicant's
written materials, letters of, recommendation, test scores, and
grades in relevant courses.
<P>
3. Multicultural experience indicative of an understanding of
and an ability to work successfully with members of different

are strongly encouraged to pursue experience with school-age children
in institutional settings (e.g., tutoring in public schools, day
care, community agencies, etc.). Special Education and Rehabilitation
students are encouraged to pursue work or volunteer experiences
in state agencies, programs for the disabled in the public or
private sector, group homes, hospitals, substance abuse programs
and human service agencies in the community.
<P>
Only those applicants who, in the judgment of the Initial Teacher
Preparation Committee or the Undergraduate Special Education and
Rehabilitation Committee, meet the standards established by these
criteria are offered admission.
<P>
The College may, from time to time, establish program initiatives
of special importance to the State of Arizona or in certain academic
areas of prominence at The University of Arizona. In such instances,
applicants whose abilities and accomplishments qualify them for
participation in these initiatives, and who meet the eligibility
requirements stipulated above, may be given preference in admission.
<P>
Meeting or exceeding minimum admission standards as outlined in
this admission policy does not in any way imply or guarantee admission
to College of Education programs.
<P>
If limitations on resources require restrictions to be placed
on the number of students admitted in a given semester or year,
students will be admitted according to the level of distinction
achieved on one or more of the criteria above or the strength
and balance of the applicant's record across the several criteria.
<P>
Please note: Students admitted to any teacher preparation program
at The University of Arizona are required to pass the Arizona
Teacher Proficiency Exam (ATPE) prior to student teaching and
are urged to take this examination early in their program of studies.
Information and test dates on the ATPE are available in the Office
of Student and Career Services.
<P>
Students majoring in teacher preparation programs outside the
College of Education (See &quot;Teaching Majors for Degrees Outside
the College of Education&quot;) are not &quot;admitted&quot; to
the College. Rather, students in these programs must meet the
admission standards of their own program and then apply for &quot;permission&quot;
to enroll in the restricted education courses required in their
major. Students enrolled in these majors must meet the following
minimum standards before enrolling in any restricted professional
education course:
<P>
1. Completion, by no later than the end of the term in which application
is made, of at least 56 units of credit applicable to a baccalaureate
degree;
<P>
2. Attainment of a cumulative grade point average of 2.500 or
better on the most recently completed 56 units. For purposes of
determining permission to enroll in restricted professional courses
in the College of Education, graded units are considered from
all institutions attended.
<P>
Students enrolled in these &quot;associate&quot; programs must
meet the same deadlines as students seeking formal admission to
the College of Education.
<P>
<B><A NAME="res"></A>RESTRICTED ENROLLMENT IN PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION
COURSES</B>
<P>
Most professional education courses in the initial teacher preparation
program are closed to students who have not been formally admitted
to the program. The restriction involves a variety of courses
in several departments of the College of Education. The following
restricted courses are open only to those students admitted to
College of Education initial teacher preparation programs or to
students admitted to teacher preparation programs outside the
College (see &quot;Teaching Majors for Degrees Outside the College
of Education&quot;). The restricted courses are:
<P>
ED 350 Schooling in America
<P>
ED P 301 Child Development
<P>
ED P 310 Learning in Schools
<P>
LRC 435 Content Area Literacy in a Multicultural School
<P>

In Special Education and Rehabilitation only two courses are restricted
to majors only: SER 481, Interviewing and Client Services, and
SER 483, Supervised Casework in Rehabilitation. At the discretion
of the instructor and depending upon resource limitations, courses
in Special Education and Rehabilitation may be limited to those
majoring or minoring in this field.
<P>
<B><A NAME="pro"></A>UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS</B>
<P>
The following undergraduate programs are currently being offered
within the departments of Teaching and Teacher Education and of
Special Education and Rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>Major in Early Childhood Education</B> 
<P>
At the time of catalog production, the major in early childhood
education was under review. Prospective students should consult
the Office of Student Services in the college for further information
regarding this major.
<P>
<B>Major in Elementary Education</B> 
<P>
Students who wish to prepare for teaching careers in grades kindergarten
through eighth grade should select a major in elementary education.
Students should check with the Office of Student and Career Services
for current degree requirements.
<P>
<B>Majors in Secondary Education</B> 
<P>
College of Education students planning to teach at the secondary
school level must complete the requirements for a teaching major
or a teaching major and minor from among the subjects and fields
listed under the &quot;Majors and Minors for Secondary School
Teaching&quot; section. Students are encouraged to contact an
advisor in the Office of Student and Career Services during their
lower-division years concerning selection of appropriate teaching
majors and minors and for current degree requirements.
<P>
<B>Major in Special Education and Rehabilitation</B> 
<P>
The Department of Special Education and Rehabilitation offers
two programs within the major of Special Education and Rehabilitation
(SER). The general SER major prepares students for entry-level
human service positions in state agencies, programs for the disabled
in the public and private sector, and group homes. Many graduates
are employed in school transition programs, mental health facilities,
corrections, private agencies serving a variety of physical handicaps,
and social service agencies.
<P>
The Deaf Studies specialization within the SER major provides
students with the linguistic and cultural competency necessary
to work with individuals who are deaf. Therefore, a major component
of the program involves developing advanced competency in American
Sign Language (the first two years of sign language course work
may be used to satisfy the University's second language requirement).
Graduates of the program will be prepared for a range of occupations
such as rehabilitation technicians, job coaches, house parents
in a school for the deaf, or interpreters, and in a range of settings
such as residential schools or service or referral agencies.
<P>
SER students will earn a Bachelor of Science in Education degree.
With this degree a student is making a tentative career commitment.
It is highly recommended that a student pursue-as many do-a master's
degree to develop specialized skills and make a professional commitment.
<P>
<B>Minor in Special Education and Rehabilitation</B> 
<P>
For students majoring in areas outside the College of Education,
a non-teaching minor in Special Education and Rehabilitation is
offered with a choice of four different emphases:
<P>
1. special education
<P>
2. general rehabilitation
<P>
3. rehabilitation with an emphasis in deaf studies
<P>
4. combined special education and rehabilitation
<P>
Interested students should contact the Office of Student and Career
Services or the Department of Special Education an Rehabilitation
for further information.
<P>
<B><A NAME="spe"></A>SPECIAL PROGRAMS</B>
<P>
<B>Bilingual Education Endorsement</B> 
<P>
Arizona and the Southwest enjoy a rich cultural heritage. Cultural
and linguistic resources abound in our communities and in our
schools. Bilingual education programs, designed to teach children
in their home language in addition to English, are an important
part of many public school districts' educational programs.
<P>
The College of Education offers two programs at the undergraduate
level in bilingual education.
<P>
The first program is combined with the general Elementary Education
program. This &quot;bilingual option&quot; includes an additional
18 semester units of coursework in bilingual education. Fluency
in the language other than English is determined by state-mandated
testing. At this time, the program is designed for bilingual Spanish/English
students. In addition, some bilingual Native American/English
students can be accommodated. The Department of Language, Reading
and Culture offers a diversity of language options in bilingual
multicultural education at the graduate level.
<P>
The other program offered in bilingual education in the College
of Education consists of a minor for secondary education majors.
The minor in bilingual/bicultural education (see &quot;Majors
and Minors for Secondary School Teaching&quot; section) consists
of 21 semester units of course work in bilingual education.
<P>
Both programs consist of course work in bilingual foundations/philosophy,
methodology, linguistics, and culture. As with the Elementary
program, fluency in the language other than English is determined
by testing.
<P>
Both programs require that student teaching be done in a bilingual
setting. This practical experience enhances the overall program
and prepares students for today's diverse classrooms. Further
information on bilingual education programs within the College
of Education is available in the Office of Student and Career
Services.
<P>
<B>Middle Level Teaching Endorsement (grades 5-9)</B> 
<P>
Prospective teachers who choose to teach at the middle school/junior
high level should possess a sound knowledge base of the developmental
characteristics of early adolescents (ages 10 to 15 years) and
the relationship of those characteristics to curriculum content,
instructional practice, and school organization. The College of
Education offers course work to meet the requirements for this
endorsement as part of either an elementary or secondary teacher
preparation program. Student teaching is done in the middle school
setting to allow for practical experience in teaching at this
age level.
<P>
One major offered in the College of Education, Language Arts/Social
Studies, is a 50-unit combination major designed for students
interested in these academic areas who particularly wish to teach
at the middle school/junior high level.
<P>
<B>Certification for Community College Teaching</B> 
<P>
The College of Education cooperates with departments in other
colleges of the University in the preparation of students who
are candidates for community college teaching certificates. The
Arizona Board of Directors for Community Colleges has established
the following standards for academic certification.
<P>
The minimum requirements for an Arizona Community College Regular
Certificate are:
<P>
1. A master's or higher earned degree with at least 24 semester
hours of upper-division and/or graduate credit in the field to
be taught, or
<P>
2. A bachelor's degree in a specific area with at least three
