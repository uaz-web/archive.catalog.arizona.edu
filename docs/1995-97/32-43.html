<B><A NAME="house"></A>HOUSING FACILITIES</B> 
<P>
The University recognizes the importance of residence hall living
as an integral part of the total educational program. The residence
halls provide a living/learning environment that reflects responsible
citizenship and concern for others and offers opportunities for
individual growth and development. A broad range of programs is
offered in the residence halls which provide opportunities to
form friendships, heighten self-awareness, increase autonomy and
broaden perspectives on the world. Inherent in a community living
environment are community standards of behavior. Students who
choose the option of living in a residence hall are expected to
conform to the community standards.
<P>
The residence halls are fully staffed by live-in personnel. The
hall directors and resident assistants are skilled in all facets
of community living. Students should feel free to seek assistance
from a staff member on any type of problem or question which may
arise. Faculty fellows are also available in several halls to
serve as academic resources for residents.
<P>
<B>Residence Hall Facilities</B> 
<P>
Seventeen residence halls are clustered in three separate residential
communities on campus and offer a variety of living options to
approximately 4,800 students. The options include both single-sex
halls and co-ed halls; various locations; a range of rental rates
and a variety of architectural styles.
<P>
Rooms in the residence halls are completely furnished. Students
are requested not to bring additional furniture with them but
do need to provide their own pillows, blankets, sheets, pillowcases,
bedspread and towels. Students care for their own rooms. Custodial
service is provided for other portions of the halls.
<P>
Eight residence halls are accessible for wheelchairs and have
other special equipment for disabled students. Most halls are
wheelchair accessible into the lobby/lounge area and main floor
areas.
<P>
<I>RESIDENCE HALL AGREEMENT AND OCCUPANCY OF ROOMS</I>-All students
applying for a residence hall are required to sign a Residence
Hall License Agreement for the full length of the term for which
application is being made. The occupancy agreement terms are concurrent
with the regular University academic sessions. Students may apply
for the academic year; spring semester only and/or one or all
of the summer sessions. Exceptions to the occupancy requirements
are provided in the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
<P>
The rental rate does not cover occupancy during the December/January
recess. All halls are closed during the December/January recess.
All halls are kept open for students during the Thanksgiving and
spring recesses. Additionally, limited facilities are available
to continuing students, at additional charge, during periods between
the beginning and end of the academic years and the summer sessions.
<P>
Only the students assigned to a specific room may occupy that
room. Room changes within a hall must be approved in advance by
the hall director of that hall. When necessary, students may be
required to move to another room to consolidate unassigned space
or exercise the option of occupying unassigned space in their
room at additional cost. Students may transfer from one residence
hall to another only with advance approval from the Department
of Residence Life.
<P>
The University reserves the right to change the residence of any
student, or to deny or cancel accommodations in cases where such
action is deemed desirable.
<P>
Students are required to vacate their rooms and check out of the
hall within 24 hours after their last final exam, withdrawal,
suspension, academic disqualification or dismissal from the hall.
<P>
<I>RESIDENCE HALL RESERVATION-</I>In order to apply for a residence
hall room, the student must first be officially admitted to the
University. Accompanying the notification of admission is the
Residence Hall License Agreement, Terms and Conditions of that
Agreement and description with rental rates of the halls. Students
desiring a reservation should complete the application/agreement
form and return it with the required deposit to the Department
of Residence Life. Do not send cash. The University cannot be
responsible for any cash deposits sent through the mail. Make
checks payable to The University of Arizona. The room deposit,
in addition to being a guarantee against cancellation of housing
application, applies against damage or loss to University property
or to other debts to the University. It does not apply to the
rent. The deposit is refunded when a student leaves the residence
hall, if all charges for loss or damage and debts to the University
have been paid.
<P>
Notification of residence hall assignments for the fall is mailed
to applicants beginning mid-April. Failure to provide required
rent confirmation payment within two weeks of assignment notification
will result in cancellation of reservation and forfeiture of deposit.
<P>
The University does not require freshmen to live in Residence
Halls and does not guarantee residence accommodations for freshman
students. <I>Demand may exceed available space; therefore, immediate
application upon admission is encouraged.</I> Priority for assignment
is based on the date the Residence Hall Agreement and deposit
are received by the Department of Residence Life.
<P>
Residence in halls is ordinarily restricted to students registered
for 12 or more units of regular University work and is not open
to noncredit, nondegree, or correspondence students. Exceptions
must be approved by the Department of Residence Life.
<P>

<P>
<U><B>Change of Address</B></U> 
<P>
It is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed
at all times of his or her current local and permanent address.
Change-of-address forms are available in the Office of the Registrar.
<P>
<B><A NAME="conduct"></A>STUDENT CONDUCT</B> 
<P>
<B>General Responsibility</B> 
<P>
When a student accepts admission to The University of Arizona,
the University assumes that the student thereby agrees to conduct
himself or herself in accordance with its community standards.
The University reserves the right, on the recommendation of the
Dean of Students and with the approval of the President, to terminate
at any time the enrollment of a student who violates these standards.
Evidence of unsatisfactory citizenship may be an overt violation
of a specific standard, or social behavior that is not acceptable.
<P>
The Office of the Registrar enforces a financial records hold
or an administrative hold on the records of a student when an
outstanding financial obligation or disciplinary action has been
reported.
<P>
When a hold is placed on a record, the following results may occur:
1) No official or unofficial transcript is issued. 2) Registration
privileges are suspended. 3) Other student services may be revoked.
<P>
The hold remains effective until removed by the initiating office.
It is the student's responsibility to clear the conditions causing
the hold.For a detailed statement of University regulations, refer
to the <I>Student Code of Conduct</I> or other applicable regulations
when subsequently generated.
<P>
<B>Use of Narcotic Drugs</B> 
<P>
The University provides information required under the Drug Free
Schools and Communities Act of 1989. This information appears
each semester in the <I>Schedule of Classes</I>. The use by a
student, or the sale, possession, or giving as a gift by him or
her of narcotic drugs, sedatives, stimulants, psychotherapeutic
drugs, psychedelic agents of any variety, prescription drugs other
than such as may be prescribed by a physician for the student's
individual use, or of any of the foregoing in violation of federal
or state law, is incompatible with and inimical to the social,
health, and safety standards and educative purposes of the University,
and shall be cause for disciplinary measures, including suspension
or expulsion, regardless of action or inaction by civil authorities
with respect to violations of the law above mentioned.
<P>
<B>Use of and Conduct upon University Property</B> 
<P>
The grounds and properties of the three universities of the State
of Arizona are owned by the state through the Arizona Board of
Regents for the use and benefit of the respective institutions.
Such properties are devoted to and maintained for the sovereign
function of supplying higher education to the people, and are
not places of unrestricted public access.
<P>
Neither the State nor the Board is obligated to furnish or supply
in such grounds and properties a forum or locale for the commission
of crime, disorders, violence, injuries to persons or property,
or the incitement or encouragement thereof, or any conduct or
activity whatsoever which will interfere with or is harmful, disruptive,
or inimical to the educational function aforesaid.
<P>
Accordingly, in the light of the foregoing and in the exercise
of the jurisdiction and control vested in it by law, the Arizona
Board of Regents has formally adopted and promulgated the following
ordinance and regulation:
<P>
No person or persons may enter upon the grounds, buildings, roadways,
or properties of The University of Arizona, Arizona State University,
or Northern Arizona University, nor may a person or persons there
be or remain, for the purpose of or in the actual or threatened
commission of, any one or more of the following: a breach of the
criminal laws (state or national); violent, obscene, or disorderly
conduct; injury to or destruction of property; interference with
free access, ingress, or egress; injury to person or persons;
seizure or exercise of unpermitted control of properties of the
institution; trespass; conduct harmful, obstructive, or disruptive
to, or which interferes with, the educational process, institutional
functions, contractual arrangements, or the public peace and tranquility;
conduct likely to foment uproar or violence; or the incitement,
support, encouragement, aid, or abetment of any or all of the
foregoing.
<P>
Access to, enjoyment of, and presence upon or within the areas
aforesaid are conditioned upon compliance with the foregoing ordinance
and regulation. Any and all persons not in compliance with the
foregoing, or in threatened or actual violation thereof, will
be denied entry to or upon such areas, or will be evicted therefrom,
as the case may be. More specific details regarding conduct appropriate
to a university campus are found in the separately published <I>Student
Code of Conduct</I> (or other applicable regulations when subsequently

<B>CAMPUS LIFE</B> 
<P>
<B><A NAME="park"></A>Parking and Transportation</B> 
<P>
Parking and Transportation Services (PTS) is committed to helping
the University community by offering a comprehensive program of
transportation services. PTS strongly encourages the use of transportation
alternatives, such as buses and bicycles, to preserve the campus
environment and to improve air quality in Tucson. PTS also encourages
prospective students to contact its office <I>prior</I> to enrollment
so it can provide assistance on transportation alternatives available
to students. For information on the following programs, write

<P>
<I>BICYCLES-</I>Parking and Transportation encourages safe, courteous
bicycling. Its programs are designed to emphasize safety and education.
Designated bicycle parking areas are provided around residence
halls and all other campus buildings. Additionally, paths are
provided for bicyclists. Bicycle riding is prohibited on sidewalks
and at other signed areas. Free bicycle registration is available
Monday through Friday (excluding University holidays) at Parking
and Transportation Services. Registering a bicycle is a proven
deterrent to theft by providing a means of identification. Registration
also helps to identify lost or stolen bicycles and is necessary
for some insurance claims.
<P>
<I>CITY BUSES-</I>The bus pass program is designed to encourage
public transit instead of automobile usage. Parking and Transportation
Services offers special discounted bus passes from August to June
(some restrictions apply and depend on funding availability).
Take advantage of this inexpensive and convenient alternative
to parking problems.
<P>
<I>MOTORCYCLES/MOPEDS/MOTORBIKES-</I>Parking and Transportation
encourages you to use this mode of transportation by providing
convenient parking locations around campus. Parking permits are
required.
<P>
<I>MOTORIZED VEHICLES-</I>Campus parking is limited. Students
are permitted to bring motor vehicles to the University but parking
is not guaranteed. <I>It is strongly recommended that vehicles
not be brought to campus unless a parking permit has been assigned.</I>
Since campus parking permits are limited, new students are encouraged
to contact the permit section of Parking and Transportation Services
as soon as they have received notification of admission. Failure
to do so may result in a delay in obtaining a permit for campus
parking lots. (Preference in assignments is given to continuing
permit holders. Remaining permits are issued to new students and
employees on a first come, first served basis.) There are several
categories of parking permits offered on this campus. Fees vary
based on the level of service.
<P>
Parking permits are required year round (including academic recess
periods, between semesters and summer sessions) from 7:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, unless the lot is posted
otherwise. Parking and traffic limitations may be imposed when
campus parking facilities are used for special events. On these
occasions notification is posted at lot entrances and informational
flyers may be placed on vehicles in the affected lot. (Example:
Vehicles parked near the football stadium on game days must be
relocated to perimeter lots on the west side of campus.)
<P>
Application materials may be picked up at Parking and Transportation
Services Permit Section.
<P>
<I>RIDESHARING-</I>Save money on maintenance and gasoline costs
and reduce parking demand by carpooling. The University provides
access to a carpool match list to team you up with others who
live near you. Call (520) 621-1800 for more information.
<P>
<I>SHUTTLE SERVICE FROM DESIGNATED PARKING LOTS-</I>The University
offers a free campus shuttle as a direct link from many of the
outlying parking areas on to campus. Ask for a free shuttle guide.
<P>
To obtain informational materials on any of these programs, please
send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to Parking and Transportation
Services.
<P>
<B><A NAME="cocur"></A>Co-curricular Policy</B> 
<P>

to a student's eligibility to participate or hold an office in
a co-curricular activity, the Dean of Students shall inform the
student and faculty advisor in writing of the nature of the ineligibility.
Appeals based on exceptional circumstances may be made to the
Co-Curricular Activities Review Committee. The committee will
review written statements of the exception and forward recommendations
to the Vice President for Student Affairs for final action.

are sponsored primarily as an aid to the educational purposes
of the University. Full control of all phases of this program
remains with and is administered by the faculty and staff of the
University. Students participating in athletics must have conformed
to normal entrance requirements and must maintain acceptable progress
toward a college degree.
<P>

of intercollegiate athletics are administered under standards
set by the Arizona Board of Regents, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, and the Pacific-10 Conference.
<P>
Scholarships awarded to properly qualified students who participate
in athletics are administered by a committee of the Office of
Student Financial Aid under standards applying to all such awards.
All funds for the support of the athletic program, regardless
of source, are accounted for by the University Comptroller and
are included in the annual audits.
<P>
<B><A NAME="asua"></A>Associated Students</B> 
<P>
The student body is organized under the title, Associated Students
of The University of Arizona (ASUA). The pur-pose is to enable
students to assume the privileges and responsibilities of self-government.
Governing authority of ASUA is vested in the elected officials
and the ASUA Supreme Court. ASUA provides a number of services
to the student body through such programs as Legal Services, Escort
Service, and Academic Services. The Associated Students also strives
to incorporate traditionally underrepresented groups through its
constituency based services that include the Minority Action Council,
International Student Association, and the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Association. Additionally, the Appropria-tions Board provides
financial support for University clubs and organizations. As part
of its role of servicing students, ASUA organizes a number of
activities throughout the year by a variety of ASUA programs including
Speaker's Board and Spring Fling.
<P>
ASUA also acts to improve the lives of students and the quality
of education on the local, state and national levels. This is
done through the advocacy positions within ASUA. These positions
include the University Budget Review Committee, Arizona Students'
Association, and the Federal Relations Office.
<P>
Furthermore the ASUA president, with the confirmation of the ASUA
Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Professional Student Council,
appoints students to many different University organizations such
as Cultural Events, Faculty Senate, Parking and Transportation
and Student Publications.
<P>
ASUA encourages all students to get involved in any of its programs,
services, or activities.
<P>
<B><A NAME="program"></A>Department of Student Programs</B> 
<P>
Many activities are available outside of the classroom. Students
can learn about these co-curricular activities at the Department
of Student Programs located in Student Union 101 and 353. The
Department of Student Programs recognizes over 280 student clubs
and organizations, provides leadership programs, campus activities
through the University Activities Board, an off-campus housing
program, coordinates the Center for Service Learning and the Center
for Off-Campus Students, and information on fraternities &amp;
sororities.
<P>
The department also coordinates Family Weekend, Wildcat Welcome,
Wildcat Camp, the Bear Down Club, and the Student Leadership Development
Program which includes peer leadership activities, retreats, skill
building workshops and academic course work.The department provides

<P>
<U><B><A NAME="frat"></A>Fraternities and Sororities</B></U> 
<P>
Fraternity and sorority membership offers opportunities for leadership,
campus participation, community involvement, and involvement as
alumni/ alumnae. They organize the social lives of their members
to promote their educational objectives. It is an experience in
living together and sharing maintenance, self-government, and
personal relations in a community that profits socially and intellectually.
Mutual selection based upon congeniality and common purposes forms
the basis for these organizations. The University of Arizona recognizes
the need for the total growth of the individual during his or
her academic experience and, therefore, has made a commitment
to organized activities such as social fraternities and sororities.
These groups are considered University-recognized student organizations
and, therefore, are subject to policies and regulations set by
the University for recognized clubs and organizations.
