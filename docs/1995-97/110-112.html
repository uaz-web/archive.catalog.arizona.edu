<B>COLLEGE OF PHARMACY</B> 
<P>
<B><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</B> 
<P>
An important objective of the College of Pharmacy is to educate
qualified students to become pharmacists who are committed to
providing the highest quality of pharmaceutical and related health
care services. These services are mainly concerned with optimizing
the therapeutic effects and minimizing the adverse effects of
drugs, and require the knowledge and skills of a drug specialist.
The practice of pharmacy requires great sensitivity to the health
care needs of people and demands a high standard of professional
integrity.
<P>
The pharmacy curriculum, which includes scientific, professional,
and general education courses, is designed to develop pharmacists
who are professionally competent and academically well-rounded.
The professional program in the College of Pharmacy is fully accredited
by the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education.
<P>
<B><A NAME="aca"></A>ACADEMIC PROGRAMS</B> 
<P>
The professional degree offered by the College of Pharmacy is
the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.). The program for this degree
is based upon approximately six years of college work (two to
three years of prepharmacy and four years in the College of Pharmacy),
as outlined below.
<P>
The college also offers graduate studies leading to the Master
of Science degree in pharmaceutical sciences, pharmacology, toxicology,
and pharmacy and the Doctor of Philosophy degree in pharmaceutical
sciences, pharmacology and toxicology, and pharmacy. For information
on the specific programs in the departments of Pharmaceutical
Sciences, Pharmacology and Toxicology, and Pharmacy Practice,
consult the<I> Departments and Courses of Instruction</I> section
of this catalog.
<P>

or universities may be accepted in fulfillment of the prepharmacy
course requirements with advisor approval.
<P>
Candidates are admitted into the professional pharmacy program
only in the fall semester. Evaluation for admission to the college
requires the following application items: (1) a completed University
of Arizona application form, (2) official transcripts of all completed
university or college courses, (3) a listing of remaining prepharmacy
courses to be completed, (4) a completed student profile questionnaire,
(5) an essay, (6) three recommendation forms, and (7) an interview.
All science courses must be complete the spring prior to admission.
All application materials, including application form and transcripts,
should be sent directly to The University of Arizona, College
of Pharmacy, Room 344, Tucson, Arizona 85721. Students who seek
admission to the College of Pharmacy are urged to initiate the

and have all application materials submitted as soon as possible,
but no later than by mid-January of the application year. Applicants
will be informed of their admission status by May.

<B><A NAME="col"></A>COLLEGE SCHOLASTIC REQUIREMENTS</B> 
<P>
Students in the four-year professional Pharm.D. program are required
to register for and complete a minimum of 14 units each semester.
The cumulative University grade-point average and the cumulative
professional grade-point average are considered for the determination
of scholastic standing in the College of Pharmacy. A student is
placed on academic probation if either grade-point average falls
below 2.000 at the end of a semester or summer session. A student
who is on probation may be disqualified at the end of the next
semester if either grade-point average is below 2.000. A student
who has been disqualified for at least a semester and who requests
readmission to the pharmacy program, must petition the College
of Pharmacy. The readmitted student is automatically placed on
academic probation and is subject to any additional conditions
that may be imposed by the faculty. See &quot;Academic Probation
and Disqualification&quot; in the <I>Academic Policies and Graduation
Requirements</I> section of this catalog.
