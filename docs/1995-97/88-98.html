<P>
<B><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</B>
<P>
Engineering education is preparation for a professional career.
While most graduates embark on careers in engineering practice,
men and women with engineering majors find the baccalaureate program
excellent preparation for other fields as diverse as law, medicine,
business and government. An engineering education develops analytical
and quantitative thinking, a critical but optimistic approach
to problem solving, and the habit of self-directed future learning.
Graduates make successful transitions to a wide variety of different
careers. The graduate has a thorough understanding of how materials,
energy, and information can be adapted to humanity's needs and
desires. This is developed through the study of physical science,
mathematics, engineering science, engineering design, humanities,
social science and practice.

<P>
<B><A NAME="acc"></A>ACCREDITATION AND THE CURRICULAR CONTENT
REQUIRED FOR ENGINEERING DEGREES</B> 
<P>
The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)
is the official agency for accrediting undergraduate engineering
degrees. As part of the required curricular content, every engineering
student must complete a minimum of 16 units of engineering design,
32 units of engineering science, and 16 units of humanities and
social sciences courses. These requirements are integrated into
the curricula that are specified on the following pages for each
engineering degree.
<P>
<B>Engineering Design (ED)</B> 
<P>
Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component,
or process to meet desired needs. It is a decision-<BR>
making process in which resources are converted optimally to meet
stated objectives. ED courses include at least some of the following
features: development of creativity, use of open-ended problems,
development and use of design methodology, formulation of problem
statements and specifications, consideration of alternative solutions,
feasibility considerations, and detailed system descriptions.
They may also include constraints such as economic factors, safety,
reliability, aesthetics, ethics, and social impact.
<P>
<B>Engineering Science (ES)</B> 
<P>
The engineering sciences have their roots in mathematics and basic
sciences, but carry knowledge toward creative application. These
studies provide a bridge between the sciences and engineering
practice. At least one ES course must be taken outside of the
department of the major.
<P>
<B>Humanities and Social Science (HSS)</B> 
<P>
The humanities are the branches of knowledge concerned with the
culture and values of the human race, and the social sciences
are studies of individual relationships in and to society. HSS
studies assist in meeting the objective of a broad education and
in meeting the objectives of the engineering profession. In the
interests of making engineers fully aware of their social responsibilities
and better able to consider related factors in the decision-making
processes, HSS course work is required as an integral part of
the engineering program.The HSS requirements must also be met
by students majoring in engineering mathematics, engineering physics,
and hydrology.
<P>

<B>BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN HYDROLOGY</B> 
<P>
Hydrology, the science of water, deals with the origin, distribution,
and the physical, chemical and biological properties of the waters
of the Earth. It has application to flood, drought, and weather-related
hazards, water supply, recreation, the design of bridges and dams,
pollution control, and other water management concerns. The hydrology
curriculum is designed to give the student a basic knowledge of
hydrology and allied subjects, including hydrologic modeling with
computer applications. Flexibility is offered through the selection
of humanities/social sciences, technical, and general electives
so that a program of study can be developed which best fits the
student's needs. Specialization options: Technical electives can
be used to obtain specialization in the areas of hydrometerology,
hydrogeology, environmental chemistry, environmental hydrology,
water resources engineering, water resources engineering-systems,
and water resources engineering-policy. Students should consult
with the department regarding development of these options.
<P>
Graduates with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Hydrology
obtain professional positions in the fields of hydrology and water
resources. Because hydrology is a natural science, instruction
is augmented at all levels with field trips in Arizona, a state
which contains a great diversity of topographic and geologic features
and climatic zones, making it a superb outdoor laboratory. The
field course and an internship/practicum sequence provide direct
experience with hydrologic measurements, testing, and data gathering.
Students apply these techniques at field sites and in research
laboratories to solve water resource problems.

<B>BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING<BR>
</B><I>(ABET Accredited)</I> 
<P>
Industrial engineering focuses on the design and implementation
of integrated systems of people, materials, machines, energy and
information. After first specifying system objectives, industrial
engineers combine technical knowledge and skill from the physical,
engineering and social sciences to design, implement, and operate
the system. The industrial engineer is charged with the responsibility
of ensuring high quality while simultaneously meeting cost and
output goals. This is accomplished through the optimal allocation
of resources throughout the system.
<P>
Industrial engineers practice in both administrative and production
segments of manufacturing and service organizations. Industrial
engineers are commonly employed in heavy industry (such as steel),
medium industry (such as plastics and computers), and light industry
(such as electronics assembly), health-care delivery, telecommunications,
transportation and government. In each of these environments,
industrial engineers are involved with a variety of systems such
as production planning, quality assurance, inventory control,
management information, facility layout, job/workplace design,
material flow, and distribution. The importance of manufacturing
is reflected by the presence of a manufacturing system engineering
option.
<P>
The modern manufacturing systems engineer designs, installs, implements,
improves and manages information-driven integrated manufacturing
systems. This option prepares students to organize, schedule,
and manage the total manufacturing system, from product design
through fabrication, distribution and consumer services.

Materials science and engineering is the study of the structure,
processing and properties of materials. The field covers the behavior
of metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, semiconductors and composites.
The curriculum in MSE includes an unusually large number of elective
courses, which can be taken both inside and outside MSE. This
is a reflection of the interdisciplinary nature of the field.
<P>
All students in MSE are required to take the ten core courses,
which cover the fundamental principles of MSE. Based upon a student's
interests, an appropriate sequence of elective courses is decided
upon with a faculty advisor in the sophomore year. Involvement
in active research programs is an important part of undergraduate
education in MSE. While participation is not mandatory, it is
highly encouraged, and students are urged to seek out faculty
and arrange for projects as early in their undergraduate careers
as possible.The MSE curriculum prepares students for employment
in materials research, development, and production. Graduates
are also prepared for graduate study in the many facets of materials

<B>BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NUCLEAR ENGINEERING<BR>
</B><I>(ABET Accredited)</I> 
<P>
Nuclear engineering is directed to the study of the release, control
and application of all forms of energy resulting from nuclear
reactions and to the utilization of the unique properties of radioactive
materials in research, medicine, and materials processing. This
branch of engineering is rooted in the physical sciences and mathematics;
its applications range from power generation to radioisotope uses
in science, medicine, and industry.
<P>
The four-year curriculum begins with a group of science and mathematics
studies designed to provide the basis for work in the engineering
sciences. Writing and computer skills are also included in the
basic curriculum. Subsequent courses provide the specific engineering
science and engineering design instruction needed to prepare for
work as a nuclear engineer. The further development of computer
skills in problem formulation, system modeling, and numerical
evaluation are an essential part of this program. Further studies
in the humanities and social sciences are included in the latter
years of the program. For some students, the opportunity to take
for the first time or expand already existing skills in a foreign
language is a welcomed option.
<P>
The objective is to develop the skills and insight to allow a
positive and creative response to new opportunities that may arise
from future technological initiatives. Of importance is the understanding
that continued intellectual development is a basic ingredient
for continued success in any engineering field, and especially
in the changing nuclear engineering discipline.
<P>
Facilities available for laboratory instruction and research include:
the TRIGA nuclear reactor, operating in either the steady or pulsed
mode; the 1.25 Mev Radiation Dynamics Electron Accelerator, operating
as a source of electrons or bremsstrahlung; a 300 curie Gamma
Ray Irradiator for materials and biological specimen irradiation.
A variety of laboratories for radioactive material counting, radiochemical
processing, materials studies on the effects of radiation, and
related studies are also available.
<P>
The major in Nuclear Engineering assumes substantial knowledge
of mathematics. Students must complete MATH 124 or 125a, MATH
223 and MATH 254.

Systems engineers design and build systems to meet the needs of
people. As computing speed and analytic sophistication have increased,
society's needs have become more varied and complex. Graduates
of the systems engineering program are prepared to face these
needs.
<P>
The goal of a systems engineer is to make the best use of resources.
Stated formally, systems engineering is concerned with the processes
and methodology of modeling, analyzing and designing technologically
advanced systems that function safely, effectively, and economically.
It requires appreciation and understanding of machines, people,
software, hardware, materials, and energy. Systems engineers work
on a wide range of activities and applications, including communication
systems, computer networking, manufacturing systems, robotics,
transportation systems, health-care systems, societal problems
and all phases of both industrial and military research and design.
To prepare students for careers of such exceptional diversity,
the systems engineering curriculum includes operations research,
probability and statistics, numerical computing methods, artificial
intelligence courses, robotics, and human factors. This is clearly
a broader program than most traditional engineering disciplines.
<P>
Since computing and related methodology are invariably an integral
part of modern systems engineering, the department offers a software
option within the systems engineering curriculum. The option is
exercised by taking the courses indicated in brackets below.
