  <p><a name="intro"><strong>Introduction</strong></a></p>
  <p>The General Catalog contains information about The University of Arizona's
  courses, academic policies, and academic programs that <font size="3">bear
  directly on progress towards completion of an</font> undergraduate
  baccalaureate degree. The various sections are explained briefly below. <strong>Students
  are responsible for knowing and understanding the contents of their </strong><a href="../policies/994/catchoice.htm">chosen
  Catalog</a>.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="personalized">Personalized Catalog/Student Link</a></strong></p>
  <p>A Personalized Catalog is available through <img border="0" src="../images/images1999/unofficial-sm.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://www.Arizona.EDU/student_link/"><em>Student
  Link</em></a>, a group of services that gives students access to their own
  personal records. Enrolled students access their information by using their
  student identification and personal identification numbers. The Personalized
  Catalog section, under Academic Information, links to Catalog pages specific
  to students' declared major, including their college, major, major department,
  degree, and year for Catalog policies (see below).</p>
  <h2 align="left"><small><small><a name="choice">Choice of Catalog</a></small></small></h2>
  <p>The General Catalog is the University's official document of record for
  departmental, college and university-wide information related to academic
  programs. Students maintaining <a href="../policies/994/contenrl.htm">continuous
  enrollment</a> follow the requirements outlined by the Catalog in effect when
  they first enroll in a public Arizona community college or university. A
  student may choose instead to follow the requirements outlined by any single
  Catalog in effect during subsequent terms of continuous enrollment. Each
  student is responsible for knowing and abiding by the policies described in
  the Catalog chosen.</p>
  <p>Students admitted or readmitted to a public Arizona community college or
  university during a summer term follow the requirements of the Catalog in
  effect the following Fall semester. Students transferring among Arizona public
  higher education institutions must meet the admission requirements, residency
  requirements, and all curricular and academic requirements of the
  degree-granting institution.</p>
  <p>UA students who follow requirements outlined in earlier Catalogs will find
  that some information about them is not available electronically. For example,
  academic policies for years earlier than 1997-1998 are not available online.
  Students governed by earlier Catalogs should speak with an advisor or consult
  the appropriate printed Catalog for such information.</p>

  <p><strong><a name="tips">Printing Catalog Pages</a></strong></p>
  <p>The UA's General Catalog is available <b> online only</b>.</p>
  <p>We have designed the General Catalog so that each page fits horizontally
  when printed on regular 8.5 inch wide paper.&nbsp; Below are some helpful tips
  to control other aspects of your printed output:</p>
  <p><strong>Printing linked pages:&nbsp; </strong>Newer versions of the <strong>Internet
  Explorer</strong> browser allow you to print a Web page as well as all the
  pages that are linked from it.&nbsp; Choose FILE, PRINT and the Print Dialog
  Box will open.&nbsp; In the bottom left corner Check the box that says
  &quot;print all linked documents&quot; and Click OK. <strong>Careful choosing
  this option!&nbsp; </strong>Be sure to browse through all the linked pages
  beforehand -- or you may end up printing many, many pages unintentionally!</p>
  <p><strong>Printing only a portion of a Web page:</strong>&nbsp; Since one Web
  page could technically be an endless number of printed pages, most browsers
  give you the option to specify a range of page numbers for printing.&nbsp;
  When you select FILE, PRINT the Print Dialog Box opens, simply enter in your
  desired page range.&nbsp; <strong>Netscape</strong> offers a convenient FILE,
  PRINT PREVIEW that you can scroll around in and note which page numbers you
  want to print before you input the page range.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Adding helpful information to printed output:&nbsp; </strong>Most
  Web browsers give you the option to add helpful header and footer information
  to your printed output, such as:&nbsp; the document title, document location
  (URL), page number, and date printed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply choose FILE, PAGE
  SETUP, make your choices, and Click OK.&nbsp; This information can come in
  very handy, especially when you refer back to these pages after a period of
  time.&nbsp; These settings will stay in affect for all subsequent print jobs
  until you change them.</p>
