  <p><b>The School:</b></p>
    <p>The School of Theatre Arts is in
    the <a href="a0.html">College of Fine Arts</a>.</p>
  <p>The School of Theatre Arts is committed to providing
  professional training at the undergraduate and graduate levels in the theatre
  arts through a program of performance-centered activities and creative
  studies, the object of which is to insure that each student acquires a
  thorough understanding and appreciation of the theatre arts through classroom
  study, studio-laboratory training, and university theatre production.&nbsp;
  The programs of study are designed for those who intend to pursue a
  professional theatre career, as well as those who may enter other fields where
  theatre skills are desirable.&nbsp; The programs are designed to instill in
  the student the highest academic standards and professional skills required to
  initiate a career in educational or professional theatre.</p>
  <p><b>Core Curriculum:</b></p>
  <p>All entering freshman, except musical theatre and
  professional acting
  majors (see admission requirements below), will
  be admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program and must follow the core
  curriculum program of study in their first year. For details, see the
  degree/major requirements (APRRs) above.</p>
<p><b>BA in Theatre Arts:</b></p>
<p>The
  Bachelor of Arts degree in Theatre Arts is designed for the student who wishes
  to study theatre as part of a liberal arts education. The B.A. curriculum
  integrates practical and academic studies in theatre with a minor and
  electives in the student's areas of interest. The program culminates in a
  Senior Capstone project involving activities such as theatre production, research, study
  abroad, or a professional internship.</p>
  <p><b>BFA Entrance Requirements:</b></p>
  <p>Students wishing to be admitted to a Bachelor of Fine Arts
  program must successfully complete an audition, interview, and/or portfolio review.</p>
<p><b>Theatre Production BFA:</b></p>
<p>The Bachelor of
  Fine Arts with a major in theatre production is an intensive professional
  training program for highly talented and motivated theatre students.&nbsp;
  Admission to the major is granted only if the student has demonstrated strong
  potential for a professional career in the theatre.&nbsp; The faculty in the
  student's area of specialization will evaluate each student's professional
  potential, trainability, and talent after an audition, interview and/or
  portfolio review.</p>

  freshman year for continuation to the sophomore level. All sophomore majors are on probation, and must successfully pass
  end of year sophomore auditions and interviews before being admitted into
  upper-division level courses and retention in the program. At each step of the process, the faculty will evaluate the

  and is by jury review and approval by the acting division faculty.</p>
