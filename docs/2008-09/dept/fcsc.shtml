    <p><b>The School:</b></p>
    <p>The John and Doris Norton School of Family and Consumer Sciences is in the <a href="al.html">College
    of Agriculture and Life Sciences</a>.</p>
  <p>The School provides instructional,
  research, extension and outreach programs that enable families, individual
  family members and consumers to achieve an optimum quality of life throughout
  the lifespan. Instructional programs prepare professionals for careers serving
  families and consumers in a culturally diverse and rapidly changing society.</p>
  <p>The undergraduate program has as its major objectives:&nbsp; 1) specialization
  in various aspects of Family and Consumer Sciences, in preparation for
  professional positions, and 2) courses to enrich the professional preparation
  of students in other colleges.</p>
  <p>The school is organized into two divisions, 1) Retailing
  and Consumer Sciences and 2) Family Studies and Human Development.</p>
  <p><b>Division of Retailing and Consumer Sciences:</b></p>
  <p>The Bachelor of Science with a major in retailing and consumer sciences (RCSC) focuses on business
  theory and practices of providing consumer products and services through
  retail channels with an emphasis on meeting consumer interests and needs.</p>
  <p>Students in the retailing and consumer sciences major study the whole
  spectrum of the industry including retailing of fashion soft goods, food, general
  merchandise, and services. The program also examines traditional store retailing as
  well as non-store retailing, such as catalogs and e-commerce.&nbsp; Three
  supplemental, specialized certificate programs are available, in food
  retailing, international retailing and visual merchandising.</p>
  <p>Course work for the major, concentrated in the upper-division portion of
  the degree program, focuses on the effective and efficient delivery of
  products and services to consumers through four core components of the
  program; products and services environment, business environment, visual and
  aesthetic environment, and consumer and global environment.</p>
  <p>It is important for students to note that they are required to meet the
  advanced upper-division standing requirement (a cumulative grade-point average
  of 2.6 or above) in retailing and consumer sciences to establish eligibility
  for the upper-division level courses in the major.</p>
  <p>Any course work that might be applicable to the upper-division professional
  core or major requirements taken while enrolled in other colleges or at other
  universities is subject to acceptance by the John and Doris Norton School of 
	Family and Consumer Sciences for degree certification purposes.</p>
  <p><i>Certificate Programs:</i> Under the Southwest Retail Center, three
  certificate programs can be completed in conjunction with, or in addition to,
  one's major field of study.</p>
  <p>The certificate program in international retailing is designed to expose
  students to topics affecting international retail businesses and to provide a
  broad understanding of multicultural businesses and social issues affecting
  retailers in selected regions of the world. Students can choose a
  specialization in one of the following world regions: Latin America and
  Mexico, Europe, or the Pacific Rim. The program is designed for retailing and
  consumer sciences majors and non-majors. Students must have completed a foreign
  language prerequisite consisting of a minimum of 8 to 10 semester hours in
  a foreign language appropriate for one of the three major world regions
  identified above.</p>
  <p>The food retailing certificate program is designed to provide students an
  opportunity to explore a career in the food retailing industry. This program
  is highly recommended for, but not limited to, students in retailing and
  consumer sciences, agricultural and resource economics, nutritional sciences
  and marketing. Students are encouraged to apply for the program at the
  beginning of the second semester of their sophomore year.</p>
  <p>The visual merchandising and display certificate program will provide
  retailing and consumer sciences majors with the opportunity to complement their
  program of study in retailing with a concentration of creative design courses
  in art, theater arts and retailing and consumer sciences. This program will
  prepare students in the optimum presentation of merchandise. It will be of
  value and benefit to those graduates who have responsibility to sell
  merchandise or who are concerned about the concept to be sold or the image to
  be projected.</p>
  <p>For additional information about the certificate programs, and for specific
  requirements, consult the Division of Retailing and Consumer Sciences at the
  office listed above or by calling (520) 621-1295.</p>
  <p><b>Division of Family Studies and Human Development:</b></p>
  <p>The major in family studies and human development focuses on generation and dissemination of
  basic and applied knowledge concerned with human development and family
  relations throughout the life span. The major in family and consumer sciences
  education leads to certification for teaching life management in public
  schools; concentrations in secondary education and family life education are
  available. Candidates for admission to undergraduate programs in family and
  consumer sciences education must present evidence of having completed 56 units
  of work applicable to the Bachelor of Science degree. Family and consumer sciences education majors will not be allowed
  to register for 300- or 400-level family and consumer sciences education or
  College of Education courses until successful completion of the writing
  proficiency exam.</p>
  <p>For additional information about the Division of Family Studies and Human Development
  contact the office listed above or call (520) 621-7127.</p>
