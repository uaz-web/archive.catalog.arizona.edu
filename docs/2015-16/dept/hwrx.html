<p>The Department of Hydrology and Water Resources is in the 
<a href="ees.html">School of Earth and Environmental Sciences</a> within the 
<a href="sci.html">College of Science</a>.</p>
  <p>The department offers the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) 
  with a major in
Environmental Hydrology and Water Resources
  and the Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)
  degrees with a major in Hydrology.&nbsp; The department also participates in
  the College of Engineering <a href="http://www.oneflexibledegree.com">Master of Engineering
	</a>(M.Eng.) program.</p>
  <p>Hydrology and water resources include the origin, distribution, and
  properties of the waters of the Earth, as well as the development and
  management of water resource systems for multiple purposes. The faculty offers
  competence in hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry, environmental hydrology,
  ground-water and surface-water hydrology, hydrometeorology, hydroclimatology,
  water quality, mathematical and statistical methods in hydrology (including
  numerical modeling), and water resources engineering, planning, management and
  administration.&nbsp; The undergraduate major assumes substantial knowledge of
  mathematics.</p>
  <p>The department participates in the honors program.&nbsp; Honors students
  complete an approved senior honors thesis in lieu of the senior capstone
  course.</p>
  <p><b>BS with a major in Environmental Hydrology and Water Resources</b></p>
  <p>Water is life: it is an essential component of our environment. Hydrology,
  the science of water, deals with the origin, distribution, and properties -
  physical, chemical and biological - of waters of the Earth and even other
  planets, such as Mars. Environmental Hydrology is the applied science that
  investigates and characterizes the environmental state of our water and
  related land and ecological resources. Hydrologists work with water resource
  problems related to pollution, its prevention and clean-up, and natural
  disasters, such as floods, droughts, and water management concerns, including
  water supply, the design of wells and reservoirs, recreation, and
  environmental impacts on water quality. Protecting the quality of water for
  all uses is a critical part of the mission of hydrologists.</p>
  <p>The hydrology curriculum is designed to give the student a basic knowledge
  of hydrology and allied subjects, including the basic environmental sciences,
  hydrologic modeling, and computer applications. Flexibility is offered through
  the selection of general education courses (Tier One and Tier Two), core
  electives, technical electives, and specialty options. The faculty offer
  expertise in the areas of hydrometeorology, hydrogeology, environmental
  chemistry, environmental hydrology, water resources engineering, water
  resources engineering-systems, and water resources engineering-policy.
  Instruction is augmented at all levels with field trips in Arizona, a state
  with great diversity of topographic and geologic features and climate zones,
  making it a superb outdoor laboratory. Field courses and a senior capstone
  course provide direct experience with hydrologic measurements, testing, and
  data gathering. Students apply these techniques at field sites and in research
  laboratories and process the resulting measurement data using computer models.</p>
  <p>The field and internship experiences, coupled with a curriculum
  encompassing environmental hydrology and water resources in depth, enable
  graduates with a Bachelor of Science with a major&nbsp; in Environmental Hydrology and Water
  Resources to obtain entry-level professional positions and to perform the
  duties of these positions in a manner that leads to rapid career advancement.</p>
