  <p>The Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering
    is affiliated with both the <a href="cals.html">College of
    Agriculture and Life Sciences</a> and the <a href="en.html">College
    of Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>All of the degree programs are administered by both colleges.</p>
  <p><b>Agricultural and Biosystems Engineers</b></p>
  <p>Agricultural and biosystems engineers integrate
  mathematics and the biological, physical and engineering sciences with
  engineering design principles. These principles are applied to the design,
  analysis, construction, and management of equipment, systems, and facilities
  for the efficient production, processing, and utilization of food, fiber, and
  biological/biochemical products. The curriculum is based on a core of courses
  required of all students with electives to place emphasis in areas such as
  agricultural engineering, biological engineering, bioenvironmental
  engineering, irrigation engineering and water resources management, and energy
  applications. Modern developments in control systems, expert systems,
  robotics, sensors, microprocessors, materials science, and computer-based
  analyses are emphasized throughout the program as appropriate. The major in
  agricultural and biosystems engineering assumes substantial knowledge of
  mathematics.</p>
  <p><b>BS in Biosystems Engineering</b></p>
  <p>The Bachelor of Science in Biosystems
  Engineering emphasizes several areas including: agricultural engineering,
  irrigation engineering and water resources management, bioenvironmental
  engineering, biological engineering, and agri-biosystems. The program includes
  a basic science core merging biological and physical sciences. Included in the
  major areas as appropriate are: energy issues and alternatives; biosystems
  analysis and design; biotechnology engineering developments; hazardous waste
  management and water quality control; soil, water, plant relationships;
  applications of sensors, control systems, digital imaging, computer vision,
  artificial intelligence and multispectral analysis; robotics; and other
  emerging technologies. Emphasis is placed upon the design of systems,
  processes and equipment to serve the engineering needs of the
  agricultural/biological industries and the water resources/environmental
  engineering needs of various government, industry, community and engineering
  consulting organizations.</p>
  <p>The Bachelor of Science in Biosystems
  Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the
  Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.&nbsp; (ABET
  Accredited)</p>
