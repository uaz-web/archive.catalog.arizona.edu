    <p>The School of Sociology is in the
    <a href="/2015-16/dept/sbs.html">College of Social and Behavioral Sciences</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Advising</b></p>
  <p>All students are strongly advised to
  meet with a major advisor and a general education advisor at least once a
  year.</p>
  <p><b>Sociology</b></p>
  <p>Sociology is the study of human society, its origins, functions and
  problems. It focuses on relations among people, groups, organizations, classes
  and cultures. Sociology explores and analyzes issues vital to our personal
  lives, our communities, our nation, and the world. The curriculum in sociology
  is designed to show students the social character of human life and the impact
  of varying forms of social organization on human affairs. Students are
  introduced to the methods by which knowledge is obtained, and may examine the
  results of research on such diverse topics as the family, religion, education,
  politics and crime. The major provides a foundation for careers in many
  professional fields, such as law, criminal justice and social service, and for
  graduate training as a professional sociologist in government, business,
  community agencies, research organizations or educational institutions.</p>
  <p><b>The Major for the B.A.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;color:black">All majors take a set of 4 core courses
(</span>introduction to sociology, social statistics, social research methods,
and sources of sociological theory) <span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;color:black">that provide a theoretical overview of the
discipline and the fundamentals of its research methods and statistics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, all majors must take course work in three of six thematic
areas: law, crime and society; organizations, communities, and
families; politics, movements, and social change; sociology of
culture; social diversity and inequality; and social psychology.&nbsp; All
students are strongly advised to review their Student Academic Advisement Report 
(SAAR) as early as possible in the process.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;color:black">Sociology
majors must satisfy the Mid-Career Writing Assessment (MCWA) prior to enrolling in SOC 300, Sources of Sociological Theory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the MCWA isn't satisfied with a minimum grade of B in the second 
semester composition course, the
student must take further developmental course work in writing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Students should consult with their academic advisor for specific
information about the department's requirements.

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;color:black">Students
planning to declare a sociology major should discuss their plans with a
Sociology advisor in the College of Social and Behavioral Science Advising 
Office. For an advising appointment, call or visit the SBS&nbsp; Advising Office, 
Douglass Building 101, 626-0606.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The office is open five days a week and administers a wide range of
programs for undergraduate majors.

<b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Preparation for Majoring or Minoring in Sociology</b></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Students who enjoy the greatest success in sociology
  typically have a desire to gain a rigorous, critical awareness about how their
  own life experiences relate to events and issues in the larger world, why
  certain groups have power and others do not, how and why social change occurs,
  and how various social problems such as inequality, crime, and discrimination
  can be improved.&nbsp; The best introductory sociology courses to enroll in
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Introduction to Sociology</li>
  <li>
Ethnic Relations in the United States</li>
  <li>
Gender, Identities, Interactions and Relationships</li>
  <li>
Individuals, Groups, and Societies</li>
</ul>
  <b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Undergraduate Scholarships, Awards</b></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;color:black">Sociology
  majors are quite competitive for a number of scholarships and awards available
  through the UA and other organizations. These awards include: the 
  <a href="http://sociology.arizona.edu/scholarships">Roger
  Yoshino Award</a>, <a href="http://web.sbs.arizona.edu/college/node/329">
  College of SBS scholarships</a>, the
  <a href="http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/centennialachievementawards">UA Centennial Award</a>,
  <a href="http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/seniorawardscriterion">Outstanding Senior Awards</a>, and other university
  awards as well as national fellowships. Some scholarships and awards involve
  cash stipends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most scholarships
  require an application and letters of recommendation from faculty.
  
  </span></p>
<b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Research / Internship Opportunities</b></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The School offers a variety of special programs and
  individual studies opportunities for its majors, including an extensive career
  internship program, a legislative internship program, the Sociology Club,
  Alpha Kappa Delta Honorary Society, and structured academic/career counseling
  for all majors in Sociology. The School invites undergraduates to take an
  active part in their own education, and encourages their participation in the
  research and scholarly activities of the faculty. Undergraduates in the
  School have actively participated in faculty research projects on dispute
  processing, emotions, family dynamics, juvenile delinquency, social movements,
  social policy, and social power.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Sociology undergraduate majors who become professional
  sociologists find a variety of exciting careers in teaching, research, and
  practice. These careers typically require advanced degrees (the M.A. or Ph.D.)
  and are not for everyone. (About 1 in 25 sociology majors at Arizona goes on
  to graduate school in sociology.) Most majors find a variety of rewarding
  careers in government, law, and business. While the sociology major does not
  provide specific training for such careers, it does provide an excellent
  educational background for a variety of professional pursuits.</p>
