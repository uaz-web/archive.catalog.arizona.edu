<p>Engagement occurs when students translate and apply their classroom learning 
into practices and experiences beyond the classroom that impact their 
professional and personal growth.&nbsp; The University recognizes that student 
engagement occurs in a variety of learning experiences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Original and collaborative advanced laboratory and field research;</li>
	<li>Creative performances, artistic endeavors, and productions;</li>
	<li>Internships and externships;</li>
	<li>Practicums and preceptorships;</li>
	<li>Study abroad experiences;</li>
	<li>Service learning projects--community-based activities to address 
	critical needs; and,</li>
  <li>Student-centered co-curricular activities that build on classroom 
  learning.</li>
</ul>
	<p>Students may complete more than one engagement experience by registering 
	for a course or non-credit experience that has a different Engagement Activity and 
	Competency.&nbsp; There is no limit on the number of student engagement 
	courses or non-credit experiences that a student may take.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Core&nbsp;Outcomes of an Engaged Learning Experience</strong><p>
	Student engagement courses or non-credit experiences are distinguished from 
	other learning experiences by the fact that they focus on the following:<ol>
<li><span class="auto-style1">
<a href="engagemt_def.htm">Engagement Activities</a></span>--develop 
	professional and personal skills.&nbsp; Each engagement experience must 
	focus on one of the following:&nbsp; community partnership, creative 
	expression, discovery, entrepreneurship, intercultural exploration, 
	leadership, or professional development.<br>&nbsp;<li><span class="auto-style1">
		<a href="engagemt_def.htm#comp">Engagement Competencies</a></span>--are the 
	lenses through which students focus their Activity to develop an 
	appreciation for and an understanding of that area.&nbsp; Each engagement 
	experience must focus on one of the following:&nbsp; civic and community 
	responsibility, diversity and identity, global and intercultural 
	comprehension, innovation and creativity, inter-disciplinarity, 
	professionalism, or sustainability.<br>&nbsp;<li><span class="auto-style1">
		<a href="engagemt_def.htm#skill">Engagement Professional and Personal 
	Skills</a></span>--are outcomes that can be assesed in relation to any engaged 
	learning experience.&nbsp; Examples include reflection and application 
	(required of all engagement experiences), communication, 
	collaboration/teamwork, problem solving, critical thinking, project 
	management, academic and non-academic career preparedness.&nbsp; Other 
	skills may be identified by the student's department or college.</li>
	</ol>
A credit-based or non-credit curricular engaged learning experience must 
	focus on one Activity and one Competency.&nbsp; In addition, it is 
	recommended that each experience contributes to the development of specific 
	professional and personal skills.<strong><p>Graduating with an Engaged 
	Learning Experience</strong><p>To graduate with an &quot;Engaged Learning Experience&quot; notation on the 
	academic transcript, students must successfully complete (1) at least one 
	credit-based engagement course at the 300 or 400-level, or (2) a non-credit 
	engagement experience that has been approved by the University Office of 
	Student Engagement.&nbsp; <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; If the upper division 
	course is assigned a regular grade, the student must achieve a C grade or 
	higher to graduate with this notation.</p>
