Truth about GRO</a></strong>&quot;</font></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Undergraduates who have not received a bachelor'sdegree from this University may repeat under the
    Grade Replacement Opportunity (GRO), only once, certain courses in which
    they received <a href="grade.htm"> grades</a> of C, D, or E.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>All undergraduates who have attempted fewer than 60 University Credits (i.e., units in residence at the UA) 
at the time of application for GRO are eligible. Students with 60 or more attempted University Credits may retake 
courses in accordance with the <a href="gro.htm">Course Repeat Policy</a>  but without use of the GRO. <br />&nbsp; </li>
<li>Graduate students are not eligible for GRO.<br>&nbsp;</li>

    <li>The repeat GRO attempt department, course number, and grading type must be
      identical to the first attempt.</li>
 		<ol type="a">
			<li>The use of GRO for Tier Two courses is
      limited to courses with the same title and course number.&nbsp; GRO of
      Tier One courses will be limited to courses with the same title (formerly 
			the
      subtitle), although course prefixes and numbers may differ.</li>
			<li>The use of GRO to replace UA main campus courses with UA South 
			courses or vice versa, is limited to courses with a corresponding 
			course prefix (e.g., ANTH-UA main prefix, and ANTV-UA South prefix), 
			the same course number and title, and which have been determined to 
			be equivalent as indicated in the Catalog course description.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	<li>&quot;Credit by Exam&quot;, &quot;Grade by Exam&quot;, &quot;Individual Studies&quot; courses, 
	&quot;Correspondence&quot; courses, &quot;<a href="success_crs.html">Success 
	Courses</a>&quot;, and &quot;Pass/Fail&quot; courses cannot be taken under GRO. 
	Individual Studies is defined as courses with numbers ending in 91 (Preceptorship), 92 (directed research),
	93 (internship), 94 (practicum), and 99 (independent study).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A total of 3 courses, not to exceed a maximum of 10 semester hours, may
      be repeated under GRO.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A GRO repeated course grade
      will replace only one previous grade. (Example: if a
      course has been graded more than once, the GRO
      repeated course grade will
      replace only one of the graded courses)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>GRO 
	requests for regular-dated classes in any session may be submitted
	online during GRO filing periods.&nbsp;

	<a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">GRO Information</a>
      page.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The repeated attempt under
      GRO is the grade used in the
      calculation of the <a href="gpa.htm">grade-point-average (GPA)</a>, even if lower than the first
      attempt, except in the case of #10 below. Both grades earned in the first
      and the GRO repeat attempts will remain on the academic record. If a student
      passes the first attempt, but fails the repeat attempt, the failing grade
      is calculated in the grade-point-average; however the units earned in the
      first attempt may be applied toward degree requirements.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>GRO repeat attempt grades of O, W, WC, WO or XO will count as attempts, but will not
      replace the grade in the first attempt.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>When the final grade for the GRO repeat attempt has been processed in the 
	Office of the Registrar, the cumulative units and grade-point-average will be adjusted.
      Grades of I, K, and Y are not final grades.<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>University, college or department policies or certain circumstances may limit the option to use the Grade Replacement
     Opportunity. Neither the department nor the Office of the Registrar is responsible for the loss of this opportunity
     due to changes in course offerings, such as course cancellation, unit change, time change, etc.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>After filing the GRO form, it becomes the
    STUDENT's RESPONSIBILITY
    to notify the <b>
