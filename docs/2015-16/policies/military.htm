<p>A Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services, by the American Council on Education (ACE), is used by The University of Arizona as a basis for evaluating U.S. Armed Forces training.</p>
<p><b>ACE Military Credit for Undergraduates</b></p>
 
<p>Military credit evaluation is completed only after a veteran or student on 
active duty has been admitted to the University and has submitted all required documentation. The UA will accept up to 
30 units of ACE-recommended military credit as transfer work toward a baccalaureate degree.  The specific credits are for training programs offered by different branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and certified by ACE, 
including basic training.  This credit will be awarded as general elective credit or department elective credit.  Credit for military service experiences also may be acquired through standardized examinations (see 
<a href="../../2013-14/policies/profexam.htm">Credit by 
Examination Policy</a>). Documented training experience that falls outside of the regular transfer credit policies of the University, 
such as credit for Military Occupational Specialties (MOS), will only be considered 
on a case-by-case basis through a <a href="../catinfo.html#seal">

<p><b>Undergraduate Credit for Military Service</b></p> 


<p>For at least eighteen months of consecutive active duty in the armed forces, terminated under honorable conditions, 4 lower division units of military science elective credit will be awarded toward a baccalaureate degree, 
as long as the total credit for military training and service does
<span class="style1">not</span> exceed 30 units.  If you have earned a commission in the U.S. Armed Forces, you may petition the Office of the Registrar for an additional 12 upper division units of military science, naval science, or aerospace studies elective credit that will apply toward a 
<span class="style1">second</span> baccalaureate degree.</p> 
  

<p><b>Graduate Credit for Military Service and Training</b></p>
