<h4 align="center">Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC)</h4>

<p>The Arizona public community colleges and the three state universities, including the UA, have agreed upon a common structure for a general education core curriculum. This common structure is called the Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC). AGEC is composed of a minimum of 35 semester units of lower-division general education course work that prepares the student for transfer.</p>
<p>Students transferring from an Arizona community college to one of the state universities have the option of completing the lower-division general education requirements at the university or completing the AGEC while at a community college.</p>
<p>Completing the AGEC will fulfill the following lower-division general education requirements at the University: composition, mathematics, Tier One and Tier Two. The University reserves the right to verify that an AGEC certified by a community college conforms to State-approved policy before the AGEC is applied toward a UA degree.  Students with an AGEC are still required to fulfill lower-division program requirements, second language, and prerequisites within their college and major/minor area of study to complete a UA degree. The requirements to satisfy the AGEC are available through the Arizona community college advising centers. </p>
<p>In the absence of a complete certified AGEC, transfer students from Arizona community colleges may meet their general education requirements with a combination of AGEC-approved courses taken before their initial enrollment at UA, along with subsequent UA general education course work.</p><p><b>Related Topics:</b></p>
