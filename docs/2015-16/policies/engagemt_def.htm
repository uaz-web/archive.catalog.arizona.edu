	and co-curricular experiences in which students participate to develop 
	professional and personal skills.<ol>
<li><span class="auto-style4">Community Partnership</span>.&nbsp; Students serve 
as part of a formal arrangement that mobilizes both the University and community 
resources to raise the visibility of community issues; increase individual and 
organizational commitment to resolving those issues; develop new solutions to 
old problems; gain new resources or make better use of existing resources to 
improve outcomes for members of the community.&nbsp; <li>
		<span class="auto-style4">Creative Expression.</span>&nbsp; Students 
		develop original works, or interpret existing ones, in independent or 
		collaborative projects that engage communities in thinking about 
		abstract concepts related to such things as everyday experiences, human 
		conditions, environmental change, and affective and emotional 
		relationships.<li><span class="auto-style4">Discovery.</span>&nbsp; Students 
		engage in independent or collaborative inquiry that contributes to a 
		wider sense of understanding, the development of solutions to 
		challenging problems, or the creation of new knowledge.<li>
		<span class="auto-style4">Entrepreneurship.</span>&nbsp; Students 
		initiate, develop, and/or manage an organization systematically, with 
		their work characterized by innovation and calculated risk-taking.&nbsp; 
		Student entrepreneurship produces an understanding of strategies and 
		skills for innovative organizational development, as well as the 
		tangible implementation of projects that respond to evolving societal 
		and marketplace challenges and deliver services that meet those 
		challenges.<li><span class="auto-style4">Intercultural Exploration.</span>&nbsp; 
		Students participate in global and international programs that challenge 
		them to think about and investigate the world, explore different 
		cultures, and place their classroom learning into a global context.<li>
		<span class="auto-style4">Leadership.</span>&nbsp; Students utilize 
		various theories, models, and styles of leadership through some role 
		within or through an organization.&nbsp; Through practice, they create 
		collaborative relationships and networks and learn to empower, mentor, 
		and influence others.&nbsp; These experiences enable students to develop 
		a self-understanding and social intelligence that helps them translate a 
		shared vision into ethical practice.</li>
		<li><span class="auto-style4">Professional Development</span>.&nbsp; 
		Students participate in activities that further their understanding, 
		commitment, skill and contribution to a body of work, field, or

		organizational culture and contribute to problem solving and 
		efficient/effective processes involving products, customers, programs, 
		and/or services.</li>

<p><strong><a name="comp">Engagement Competencies</a></strong></p>
	<p>Engagement Competencies are the lenses through which students focus their 
	Engagement Activity to develop an appreciation for and a comprehensive 
	understanding of that area or lens.<ol>
<li><span class="auto-style4">Civic and Community Responsibility.</span>&nbsp; 
Students develop an understanding of government and community systems in order 
to contribute to the social cohesion, capacity, and governance of a community.&nbsp;

model inclusive decision-making, foster relationships of reciprocity in their 
service/volunteer activities, critically reflect on issues, and educate and 
facilitate the civic engagement of others.<li><span class="auto-style4">
		Diversity and Identity.</span>&nbsp; Students develop explicit 
		understandings of the sociocultural, linguistic, economic, and political 
		experiences of diverse groups representing varying identities and 
		societies, both their own and others, and apply those understandings

		identity as a Competency is based on developing an appreciation for differences and a 
		sense of an inclusive community.<li><span class="auto-style4">Global and

		understanding of global issues and the worldwide impact of individual

		critically about the world through interaction and collaboration with 
		cultures and societies that are different from their own.</li>
		<li><span class="auto-style4">Innovation and Creativity</span>.&nbsp; 
		Students gain an understanding of how to deliberately apply information, 
		imagination, creative thinking, and initiative to generate new ideas for 
		the purpose of addressing needs.&nbsp; This process helps students

		the excitement of idea generation and exploration at the leading edge of 
		thought.</li>
		<li><span class="auto-style4">Interdisciplinarity</span>.&nbsp; Students 
		gain an understanding of how to bring together novel and original 
		thinking across disciplines to build on knowledge, practices, theories, 
		or methodologies.&nbsp; Students network and establish relationships 
		that cut across disciplines in the pursuit of common tasks.</li>
		<li><span class="auto-style4">Professionalism</span>.&nbsp; Students 
		develop a heightened understanding of themselves and others as they

		professional etiquette and expertise.&nbsp; Based on these experiences, 
		students learn to communicate in an articulate and positive manner, act 
		with integrity, and expand the boundaries of expectation toward a 
		standard of excellence in their work and life.</li>
		<li><span class="auto-style4">Sustainability</span>.&nbsp; Students gain 
		an understanding of the social, environmental, and economic dimensions 
		of conditions or practices that make society vulnerable and 
		unsustainable over multi-generational time scales.&nbsp; Through the 
		exploration of issues from a sustainability perspective, students 
		develop potential solutions to these challenges through the use of 
		systems thinking to improve the quality of life for 
		all--environmentally, socially, and economically--both now and for 
		future generations.</li>
