<p><strong>Guidelines for Engagement Courses:</strong><ol>
<li>Credit-based engagement courses may be offered by an academic college or 
department.<li>The &quot;engaged learning experience&quot; attribute may be assigned at 
		the course or section level.&nbsp;
		<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">
		In addtion, for house numbered courses, the engagement attribute may be 
		assigned at the student level.</span><li>All student engagement courses must have 
		a syllabus detailing:&nbsp; (1) an Engagement Activity, (2) an 
		Engagement Competency, (3) student learning outcomes, (4) grading 
		policy, (5) expected work products and reflection activities, and (6) 
		all other components in compliance with the 
		<a href="http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/undergraduate-course-syllabus-policy">Undergraduate Course Syllabus 
		Policy</a>.<li>The home department and college must approve the engagement 
		course syllabus.&nbsp; No course will be identified in the Course 
		Catalog or Schedule of Classes as meeting the University's criteria for 
		an &quot;engaged learning experience&quot; without college approval.<li>
		<a href="grade.htm">Grading 
		System</a>:&nbsp; Per the course category (e.g., Individual Studies, Small 
		Group Courses) engagement courses may be offered for the S,P,F,I 
		alternative grading system, Pass/Fail system, or Regular Grades, as long 
		as the system is identified in the syllabus.&nbsp; The grading system is 
		determined by the offering instructor and applied consistently at the 
		section level of that course.&nbsp; <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; For 
		upper division courses with regular grades, students must earn a C grade 
		or higher to graduate with the notation, &quot;Engaged Learning Experience&quot; 
		on their transcript.&nbsp; Colleges may require a grade higher than 
		C-level for their students to earn this notation.<li>Courses may be 
		offered online, in person, or in hybrid format.</li>
	</ol>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Non-Credit Engagement Experiences:</strong></p>

	Learning Experience&quot; by registering for one of the University's approved 
	non-credit experiences.&nbsp; The <a target="_parent" href="../catinfo.html#seal"><img alt="External Link" border="0" height="15" src="/2011-12/images/globe-external.gif" width="15"></a><a href="http://ose.arizona.edu/">Office of Student Engagement</a> maintains a

		Competency related to the experience; and<li>Include information on (1) 
		supervision by faculty or staff, (2) required hours of
