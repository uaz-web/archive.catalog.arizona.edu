    <p>The Department of Computer Science is
    in the <a href="sci.html">College of Science</a>.</p>
  <p>Computer science is the body of knowledge dealing with the design,
  analysis, implementation, efficiency and application of algorithmic processes
  that transform information.</p>
  <p><b>The Baccalaureate Program:</b></p>
  <p>The baccalaureate program prepares students for careers developing computer 
  applications and computer systems in science and industry, and prepares 
  students for graduate study in computing. The program has three components: 
  the pre-major, supporting science courses, and the major. All students are 
  admitted to The University of Arizona as pre-computer science majors. Formal 
  application for admission to the major is required after completing the 
  pre-major course work. Admission to the major in Computer Science is 
  competitive and based on academic performance prior to application. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>minimum of 3.000 cumulative GPA at The University of
      Arizona</li>
    <li>grades of A or B in all computer science and math courses</li>
  </ol>

  major</a> web page for more details.

  <p>The department participates in the honors program.</p>
<p><strong>The Accelerated Master's Program:</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Computer Science offers an Accelerated Master's Program 
(AMP) which enables qualified and motivated undergraduates to complete both the 
B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science in 5 years. The B.S. and M.S. 
components dovetail in the students' fourth year, where they simultaneously 
complete their baccalaureate study and begin graduate work. Students complete 
their M.S. during their fifth year. </p>
<p>See the department's
<a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/AMP/Accelerated_MS_Program.html">Accelerated 
Master's Program</a> page for more details. </p>
<p><strong>The Graduate Program:</strong></p>
<p>The Master of Science (M.S.) program offers students strong academic 
preparation for work in industry and research. Most students complete a course 
work-based degree; students who are especially well-prepared may be approved for 
the thesis option. Students who successfully complete a M.S. degree may command 
a higher salary and positions with more authority and autonomy in the industry. </p>
<p>The Ph.D. program is designed to provide students with advanced course work 
and substantive research experience to allow them to be the leaders in industry 
and academe. There is a premium on producing original work presented at 
conferences or published in peer-reviewed journals. Students who successfully 
complete the Ph.D. program may go on to take leadership, entrepreneurial and 
scholarly positions.</p>
