<p><strong>The Bachelor of General Studies Program</strong></p>
<p>The BGS is an alternative to the University's B.A. and B.S. degrees. It 
provides students with a liberal arts and sciences education, broad enough to 
make one both an outstanding citizen and a lifelong lover of learning. Graduates 
of this multi-disciplinary program will be more competitive in the job market with employers who do 
not require expertise in a particular discipline but nonetheless want to hire 
college graduates who are proficient in various modes of communication, 
critical thinking, and analytic skills. </p>
<p><strong>The Global Studies Program</strong></p>
<p>The Global Studies program creates opportunities for students to engage in 
international research, internship opportunities, and study abroad; it taps into Arizona's 
unique location on an international border and takes advantage of world class 
strengths in traditional disciplines. It represents an effort to globalize areas 
of study with the addition of an international perspective, 
particularly in public health, the environment, literature, the arts, and 
cultural studies. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Interdisciplinary Studies Program </b></p>
<p>The Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) major is for students whose 
academic and career goals are not well served with a traditional major and 
minor. The program allows students to have a custom-designed major, 
individualized to reflect personal interests, values and needs. It requires at 
least 21 units in three (3) subject areas. To be accepted to the major, a 
student must demonstrate how the choice of three areas complement each other to 
form a coherent “theme” and how these three areas better prepare the student for 
his/her academic and career goals than a traditional major and minor.</p>
<p>An IDS application may be submitted after completing a minimum of 30 units 
and must be submitted prior to enrolling in the last 30 units for the degree. 
Contact the <a href="http://ces.arizona.edu">Center for Exploratory Students</a> 
to obtain more information and/or an application for the IDS program.</p>
