 -- Erosion Processes and Control
 </b>&nbsp;(2 units) <br><b>Temporary course:</b>&nbsp; offered during Fall 2009 only.<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; People have been the main cause of soil erosion for over 1,000 years. According to studies, human activities cause about ten times more erosion than all natural processes together. It is well known that the rates of soil erosion overpass those of soil formation. Worldwide, millions of acres of productive land are lost every year as a result of inappropriate land management practices. This lack of soil conservation is common in certain areas, such as forestry, agriculture, grazing, mining, and construction, among others. 

Though there are several universities worldwide in which soil conservation courses are taught, most of those courses are conceptual rather than practical. As a result, natural resources managers see themselves incapable of solving any soil loss problem. Erosion Processes and Control is one of the few courses in which design procedures to face any erosion situation are taught, so that the land does not loose its productivity, despite any previously applied management.
