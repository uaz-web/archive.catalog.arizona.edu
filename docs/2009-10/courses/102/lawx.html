The initial class sessions will introduce the students to the relevant legal frame work, the issues confronting public resource managers, and examples of collaborative decision-making.  Students will then be introduced to a scenario concerning the management of a national forest and the need to balance a broad range of interests including ecosystem restoration, economic development, recreational use, tribal concerns, and local government.  Students will be assigned roles representing these interests, design a process for addressing the conflicting interests, and negotiate certain elements of a forest management plan.  The class will then compare what happened in the simulation with actual cases.  At the conclusion of the course, students will submit a 10-15 page paper evaluating the simulation by analyzing an issue such as how effectively the collaboration process balanced the tension between inclusiveness and practicality, or how the negotiation could have been changed to be more effective.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; This course is offered for <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#passfail">pass/fail only</a>.

Most law students are familiar with the basic concepts of personal injury litigation, at least of the “red car hits blue car” genre.

The course will be both practical and theoretical.  In addition to readings in a traditional casebook, students will study the basic steps of a medical liability case from the client interview through accepting a case, doing discovery and pretrial work, trial, and appeal.  Documents will be available if the student wishes to build a “form file” for future use.  Examination of the various stages of medical liability litigation and the textbook material will both entail consideration of underlying strategic, policy, and jurisprudential issues.

Two special problems follow:  aesthetic regulation (along with its First Amendment implications), and subdivision regulation, especially as the latter is used to finance urban infrastructure.

 </b>&nbsp;(1-3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; Election law, as the 2000 presidential election dramatically illustrated, sets the ground rules for the most fundamental process in our democracy; the use of voting to determine who governs or, through an initiative or referendum, to determine substantive law.  These issues are especially relevant in Arizona, where voters have approved a number of election-related reforms.
This course will review the key constitutional provisions, statutes, and court decisions governing such topics as the expansion of the franchise, presidential selection, redistricting, campaign finance reform, and direct democracy.

In 1997, Chief Justice Rehnquist commented at the University of Virginia Law School:  “. . . there are at least three courses offered just on the First Amendment  . . . . By contrast, there seems to be no course offering devoted to federal regulation of employer-employee benefit and retirement plans–an area of the law which is much less glamorous, receives much less media attention, but the ramifications of which have a far greater effect on the daily lives of people than do the nuances of First Amendment law.  Surely practitioners are much more likely to have clients with pension and benefit plan problems than with separation of church and state problems.”<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.
