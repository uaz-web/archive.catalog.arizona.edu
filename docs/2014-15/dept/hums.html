  <p>The College of Humanities offers programs dedicated to
  literacy, language-learning, and cross-cultural understanding. The college
  includes several interdisciplinary programs, and offers degrees in over
  thirteen languages. It also supports special emphases in creative writing,
  English as a second language, religious studies,
  and classical archaeology, as well as public programs
  offered by the Poetry Center and the Humanities Seminars.&nbsp; In addition, College of
  Humanities faculty contribute heavily to the Graduate
  Interdisciplinary Program of Second Language Acquisition and Teaching.</p>
  <p><b>Academic Policies</b></p>
<p>No more than 48 units within the major may be applied
  toward the BA degree.&nbsp; That applies to Honors courses in the major
  and courses cross-listed with an academic committee or center.&nbsp; Excluded
  from the 48-unit rule are freshman composition, the first year (elementary) of
  a foreign language (see department headings for exceptions) and courses
  cross-listed with a second academic department if the latter is the home
  department.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Credit will not be awarded for language 
courses equivalent to, or at a lower level than, elementary or intermediate 
language courses for which the student has already earned credit (i.e., 
University Credit, transfer credit, or credit by exam).<i>&nbsp; </i>This policy 
applies to all languages offered by the College of Humanities:&nbsp; Chinese, 
Critical Languages, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, 
Russian, and Spanish.</span></p>
  <p><b>General Education Program</b></p>
  <p>All undergraduate students are required to complete a common
  <a href="../gened.html">General Education</a> program. Designed to provide a foundation for university
  learning, the program develops students- creative and analytical skills and
  integrates knowledge across university disciplines.</p>
  <p><b>General Advising</b></p>
<p>Each department in the College of Humanities has major advisors that are
available to answer your questions regarding admission to the major,
registration planning, transfer credit, internships, and degree checks.</p>
<p>General education advising for all majors takes place in the College of
Humanities Academic Advising Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advising center also provides information about college and University
policies and procedures, declaration of major and minor, student-initiated
petitions, student academic progress, and educational decision-making.</p>
