    <p>The Department of Philosophy is in
    the <a href="sbs.html">College of Social and Behavioral Sciences</a>.</p>
  <p>Philosophy attempts to answer analytic and speculative questions that
  perplex reflective people when they examine their basic concepts, goals, and
  ideals. Some of these questions arise naturally in the course of work in the
  various sciences and humanities. Hence philosophy has a natural border with
  all other academic disciplines, and lends itself to joint studies and
  collaborations. The department encourages a double major in a related field
  such as psychology, political science, economics, or linguistics, among
  others. Specialized minors in philosophy are available for students planning
  careers in law or the health professions. For details, students should consult
  the philosophy department's undergraduate advisor.</p>
  <p><b>BA in Philosophy:</b></p>
  <p>The BA in Philosophy includes course work from each of the following
  groups: (1) history of ancient philosophy; (2) history of medieval philosophy;
  (3) history of modern philosophy; (4) ethics and value theory; (5) metaphysics
  and epistemology; (6) logic and language. Advanced work in certain specialized
  areas within philosophy may require higher mathematical knowledge. Students
  preparing to pursue graduate work in these areas should consult with the
  undergraduate advisor about appropriate mathematics courses. The supporting
  minor should also be chosen after consultation with the undergraduate advisor.</p>
<p><strong>BA in Philosophy, Politics, Economics and Law:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">
The Departments of Philosophy and Economics, and the School of Government and 
Public Policy, in partnership with the Center for the Philosophy of Freedom, 
together offer this interdisciplinary program designed for students pursuing 
careers in public or private law, corporate industry, government, public policy 
institutes, or private foundations. The program prepares students for employment 
or for graduate or professional degrees in law, business, or public 
administration. The major is composed of three components: (1) foundation 
courses in philosophy, politics, and economics; (2) core courses stressing the 
ties between social analysis and analytical thinking on ethics; and (3) a 
specialization track of in-depth study in the student'sarea of interest. The 
program is administered by the Philosophy Department.
