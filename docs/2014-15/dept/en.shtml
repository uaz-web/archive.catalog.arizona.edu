  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>An engineering education is preparation for a professional career. While
  most graduates embark on careers in engineering practice, women and men with
  engineering majors find the baccalaureate program excellent preparation for
  other fields as diverse as law, medicine, business, and government.
  Engineering education develops analytical and quantitative thinking, a
  critical but optimistic approach to problem solving, and the habit of
  self-directed future learning. The graduate has a thorough understanding of
  how materials, energy, and information can be adapted to human needs. This
  understanding is developed through the study of physical science, mathematics,
  engineering science, engineering design, humanities, social science and
  practice.</p>
<p><strong>Entrance Requirements</strong></p>
  <p>Entrance requirements are subject to change from year to year. 
  Students seeking admission to the College of Engineering are required to meet 
  the entrance requirements for the year the student seeks admission to the 
  college.</p>
<p><a name="Advanced Standing"><b>Advanced Standing</b></a></p>
<p>Students must have been granted advanced standing to enroll
  in 300- or 400-level courses in the College of Engineering. The criteria for achieving advanced standing are available on the
college's homepage.</p>
  <p><b>Academic Advising</b></p>
  <p>Visit your advisor every semester.&nbsp; Academic advisors are assigned by
  contacting the departmental offices.</p>
  <p><b>Freshman Honors Program</b></p>
  <p>The College of Engineering Freshman Honors Program recognizes
  the abilities and achievements of high school graduates and offers a variety
  of special challenges and resources to encourage the full development of
  academic and interpersonal skills.&nbsp; Freshman honors students are strongly
  encouraged to register for ENGR 196A, 196B and ENGR 102H.</p>
  <p><b>Accreditation and the Curricular Content Required for Engineering
  Degrees</b></p>
  <p>The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is the
  official agency for accrediting undergraduate engineering degrees. For more
  information about ABET requirements, contact the college's Office of Academic
  Affairs at 621-6032.</p>
  <p><b>Scholarships</b></p>
  <p>A limited number of scholarships are recommended each year by departments
  within the College of Engineering. Students interested in applying
  for these scholarships should contact their departmental offices for
  information. It is usually best to do this prior to March 1.</p>
  <p><b>Multicultural Engineering Program</b></p>
<p>The Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP) is an academically-based
  student support program for ethnic minorities and women. For additional
  information, please contact Ray Umashankar, MEP Director, (520) 621-8103,
  Engineering Building, Room 200 or see the college homepage.</p>
  <p><b>Career Preparation</b></p>
  <p>It is recommended that all engineering students participate in a career
  experience prior to graduation. This experience can be gained by a full-time
  cooperative education work experience, a part-time internship in a local
  company, part-time or summer career employment, or a research experience in a
  faculty member's laboratory. Information is available through the Academic
  Affairs Office in Room 200, Engineering Building.</p>
