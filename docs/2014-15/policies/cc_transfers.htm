Arizona Community College Transfer 
Courses to UA General Education 
Requirements <br>
(for students without a certified AGEC)</h4>

<p>For students who have not completed the 
<a href="agec.htm">Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC)</a>, Arizona community college 
transfer courses will apply to the <a href="../gened_fdns.html">Foundations</a> component of the UA General 
Education Curriculum based on equivalencies in the 
<a href="http://www.aztransfer.com/home">Course Applicability 
System (CAS)</a>. </p>
<p>Community college courses determined 
by the University of Arizona University-wide General Education Committee 
to be equivalent to Tier One and Tier Two courses as noted in the CAS 
will transfer on a course-by-course basis and fulfill the respective 
requirements. Additionally, the University of Arizona will accept one 
or more courses identified by CAS as department elective credit toward 
Tier One and Tier Two requirements in the following manner:  <br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li>Transfer applicability will 
  be determined on a course-by-course basis by a UA academic 
	<a href="http://advising.arizona.edu/content/academic-advisor-directory">advisor</a> in 
  the college of the student’s primary major. </li>
  <li><a href="../gened_tiers.html#tier1">Tier One Traditions &amp; 
  Cultures</a> and <a href="../gened_tiers.html#tier2">Tier Two Humanities</a> requirements can be fulfilled using 
  courses in humanities, literature, philosophy, religion, and/or western 
  civilization from the AGEC Arts &amp; Humanities category.  Students 
  should choose courses from more than one discipline. </li>

  <li>The <a href="../gened_tiers.html#tier2">Tier Two Arts</a> requirement 
  can be fulfilled using 3 credits from Art, Dance, Music, and/or Theatre 
  Arts courses from the AGEC Arts &amp; Humanities category.</li>
  <li><a href="../gened_tiers.html#tier1">Tier One</a> and 
	<a href="../gened_tiers.html#tier2">Tier Two</a> Individuals 
  &amp; Societies requirements can be fulfilled by using AGEC Social &amp; 
  Behavioral Sciences courses or courses from anthropology, economics, 
  ethnic/race/gender studies, history, political science, psychology, 
  cultural geography, linguistics, or sociology. Students should choose 
  courses from more than one discipline. </li>
  <li><a href="../gened_tiers.html#tier1">Tier One</a> and 
	<a href="../gened_tiers.html#tier2">Tier Two</a> Natural 
  Sciences requirements can be fulfilled by using AGEC Physical &amp; 
  Biological Sciences courses or laboratory science courses from astronomy, 
  biology, botany, environmental science, chemistry, geology, physics, 
  physical geography, or zoology. Students should choose courses from 
  more than one discipline<b>. </b></li>

  <li>To satisfy the <a href="../gened_tiers.html#diverse">Diversity Emphasis</a> 
  Requirement, students must obtain approval from their University academic 
  advisor, since there is no equivalent AGEC category from which to select 
  a course focusing on gender, race, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, 
  or non-Western area studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>When incorporating one or more transfer 
courses to satisfy General Education requirements, students should seek 
<a href="http://advising.arizona.edu/content/academic-advisor-directory">advising</a> at the University of Arizona to ensure the breadth of exposure 
central to the General Education curriculum. Students completing an AGEC at a community college should obtain General Education advising 
at the community college. Advising for major-specific requirements should 
be obtained at the University.  <br></p>
