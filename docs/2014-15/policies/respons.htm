<h2 align="center">Academic Policies</h2>
<h4 align="center">Student Responsibility and Degree Requirements</h4>
<p>The University, its colleges, and departments establish certain academic
  requirements which must be met before a degree is granted.&nbsp; These requirements
  concern such things as curricula and courses, majors and minors, and
University credit.&nbsp; <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
<a href="http://advising.arizona.edu/content/academic-advisor-directory">Advisors</a>, faculty, directors, department heads, and deans are
  available to help the student understand and arrange to meet these
  requirements, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>At the end of the student's course of study, if requirements for
  graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted.&nbsp; It is
  important for each student to be acquainted with their <a href="catchoice.htm">chosen
  Catalog</a> and to be responsible for completing requirements.</b>
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Content in the Catalog concerning regulations, fees, curricula, or other
  matters is subject to change without notice.&nbsp; Courses, programs, and
requirements described in the catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted,
supplemented, or changed in any manner at any time at the sole discretion of the
University of Arizona and the Arizona Board of Regents.&nbsp; The catalog does
not establish a contractual relationship, but it summarizes the total
requirements which the student must presently meet before qualifying for a
faculty recommendation to the Arizona Board of Regents to award a degree. For this reason, <b> students must
  remain currently informed about all policies</b> and other information that bears
  directly on completing a degree program.</p>
  <p>This online Catalog is the official General Catalog of the
  University of Arizona.&nbsp; Students may access the Catalog from any computer
  connected to the Internet.</p>
