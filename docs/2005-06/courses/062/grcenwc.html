 -- The Social Construction of Race:  Whiteness
 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; In constructing this course, the recognition of Whiteness/Blackness is not solely a reactionary response to challenges from persons of color; it is also a reflection of the need to provide a narrative of Whiteness/Blackness that intends an understanding of the notion of Whiteness/Blackness as a racial category and the implications of this categorization and association.  For example, naming Whiteness displaced it from the unmarked, and unnamed status that is itself an effect of dominance.  Within the particular disciplines of Anthropology and Ethnic Studies, Whiteness, Blackness and Race have come to be earnest subjects of study.  Being White or Black in the 1990's, however, is far from straightforward.  It is riddled with ambiguity and marked by a general sense of racial angst as to what it means to be White or Black.  This course will attempt to respond to the question:  What does it mean to be Black/White in our global climate?<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.
