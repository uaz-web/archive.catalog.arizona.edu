The Department of Entomology provides instruction to students
planning careers in entomology and for those specializing in
related fields including plant and animal protection. Career
opportunities in entomology include teaching, research and
technical positions with colleges and universities, experiment
stations, governmental agencies, military services, private and
industrial organizations.

The department administers an undergraduate minor in entomology
and advanced degrees, the Master of Science and Doctor of
Philosophy with a major in entomology. For graduate admission and
degree requirements, consult the Graduate Catalog. 

The undergraduate minor:  The department offers students the
opportunity to complete an undergraduate minor in entomology. The
minor requires at least 20 units of credit to be selected from
course offerings in entomology. Specific course requirements
include 201; three courses chosen from 404, 407, 411, 416, 444;
and six or more credits selected from the upper-division courses
offered by the department. For further details, consult with a
faculty advisor in the department. Students will be expected to
have completed prerequisites and/or supporting courses that may
be required by the courses in the minor.
