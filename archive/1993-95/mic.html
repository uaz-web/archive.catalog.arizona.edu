The program in Microbiology is based in the College of
Agriculture but offers both the Bachelor of Science (through the
Faculty of Science) and the Bachelor of Science in Agriculture
(through the College of Agriculture). Participating faculty are
from the Departments of Plant Pathology, Soil and Water Science,
Plant Sciences, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Veterinary
Science, Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, and Civil
Engineering. An undergraduate program coordinator assists in
establishing advising assignments and policy administration.
Student advising is by faculty in the various departments.
Contact the program secretary in Room 202, Pharmacy-Microbiology
(621-6903) for assignment of an advisor.

Students seeking the Bachelor of Science degree must complete the
general education requirements prescribed by the Faculty of
Science, in addition to the following:

The major: 35 units, including 181R, 182, 317, 419, 421a, 421b,
428 and 495a. CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b, 241a-241b, 243a-243b,
and 323/323 or 325/326, PHYS 102a-102b, or 104a-104b, and 180a-
180b, BIOC 460 or 462a-462b, MATH through calculus (123, 124, or
125a), and STAT 263 are also required.

Students seeking the Bachelor of Science in Agriculture degree
must complete the general education requirements of the College
of Agriculture, in addition to the following:

The major: 35 units, including 181R, 182, 317, 419, 421a, 421b,
428, and 495a. CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b, 241a-241b, 243a-243b,

to complete 12 units in an Agriculture-based department. If taken
from an approved list (available from the program office or an
advisor), these units may count toward the major requirement of
35 units.

The minor: Students seeking either degree within the program have
the option of a structured minor in chemistry.
