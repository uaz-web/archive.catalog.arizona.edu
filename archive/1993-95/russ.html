The Department of Russian and Slavic Languages provides
instruction designed to develop competence in the Russian
language, awareness of cultural traditions, and an understanding
of literature and the arts. All Russian conversation courses are
oriented toward developing proficiency skills as defined by the
American Council on the Teaching of Foreign languages (ACTFL).
The basic training received by Russian majors prepares them for
government service, international business careers, teaching,
graduate study, and research. The Study Abroad Programs in Russia
provide an opportunity for Russian language study in St.
Petersburg and Moscow. In addition, the Study Abroad Programs in
Russia provide an intensive business Russian program with
internships in Russian and foreign firms that do business in
Moscow. Information regarding these semester and summer programs
may be obtained in the Russian department, Modern Languages 340.

The degrees available are Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts
with a major in Russian. Students in the College of Education may
earn a Bachelor of Arts in Education with a teaching major in
