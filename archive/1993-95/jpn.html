The Department of East Asian Studies offers instruction in the
study of the languages, cultures, and civilizations of China and
Japan, Asian humanities and religions, and Asian-American
studies. Programs of study may emphasize the language,
linguistics, literature, history, thought, religion, or society,
ancient or modern, of one or more cultural areas. Courses related
to East Asia are also taught in the departments of Anthropology,
Economics, History, Media Arts, and Political Science.

The department offers the Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and
Doctor of Philosophy degrees with a major in East Asian studies.
Undergraduate majors may specialize in China or Japan, or in
discipline-focused studies of South and East Asian subjects. Many
departmental courses satisfy general education and special
requirements set by other colleges, departments, and programs.
Consult the Graduate Catalog for information on the graduate
degree program.

The undergraduate major: Completion of CHN 402 or JPN 202 or
equivalent Chinese or Japanese language, and a minimum of 34
units beyond the first year of language, including a 3-unit
senior requirement. An East Asian studies concentration in an
interdisciplinary studies major requires completion of 24 units
in the department. The student's program of study for either
major must be devised in consultation with the departmental
undergraduate advisor according to departmental guidelines. The
supporting minor may be chosen, with the consent of the advisor,
from outside the department or from another area of
specialization within the department.

The undergraduate minor: Completion of 20 units in the
department. Minors may focus on one East Asian language or
culture, on one disciplinary approach, on one theme in East Asian
studies related to courses taken from one other department (split
minor), or on special student needs. The program of study must be
devised in consultation with the departmental undergraduate
advisor according to departmental guidelines.

A teaching minor for College of Education majors requires at
least 9 units taken from among the following courses: CHN 142,
174, EAS 270, JPN 144, 272, and at least 9 additional units from
the department selected in consultation with the departmental
advisor.

The department participates in the honors program.

The courses listed below are grouped by areas of specialization
within the East Asian studies major.

For purposes of appropriate placement, enrollment in all language
courses is based on performance in previous language courses at
the University of Arizona and/or placement exams given and
evaluated under the supervision of the departmental language
coordinators.
