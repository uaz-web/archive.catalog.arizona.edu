The School of Renewable Natural Resources is concerned with the
management and conservation of natural ecosystems of arid and
semi-arid environments. Programs of study in the School prepare
students for careers in management with environmental science and
natural resource agencies and organizations that require a
fundamental knowledge about the science, planning and management
of natural systems to provide the resources of water, wood,
forage, wildlife, fisheries, soil and aesthetic values.

The Bachelor of Science in Renewable Natural Resources is
available with majors in range management, watershed management
and wildlife and fisheries science. Undergraduate minors are
available in these general areas of study. The degree is composed
of general education and supporting science courses, a series of
interdisciplinary renewable natural resource courses, and courses
that develop additional knowledge in subjects specific to each
major. The natural resource core curriculum is designed to
integrate subjects of importance to all students in renewable
natural resource fields, to introduce students to the
interdisciplinary nature of resource management, and to develop
an understanding of multiple-use management systems. A major in
landscape architecture for the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture
and Master of Landscape Architecture are also offered. In
addition, a student may obtain the degree of Master of Science or
Doctor of Philosophy with a major in range management, watershed
management, wildlife and fisheries science, or renewable natural
resources studies. For information concerning graduate admission
and degree requirements, consult the Graduate Catalog.

William H. Havens, Program Leader

Landscape Architecture (L AR)

The five-year curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Landscape
Architecture is composed of two preprofessional and three
professional years. The curriculum is designed to prepare the
student to meet entry-level requirements for the profession of
landscape architecture. While the principles of professional
practice are universal, the program encourages strong linkages in
renewable natural resources and recognition of the unique
qualities of the arid Southwest.

Each applicant must comply with University of Arizona
requirements for admission to the preprofessional phase. Each
applicant to the professional phase must submit an Application
for Admission to the Professional Major form to the Program
Leader by April 15 preceding the intended fall admission.
Students are admitted to the professional phase in the fall
semester only, after having completed the following courses: CHEM
101a, 102a; ECOL 130; ENGL 101, 102 or 103H, 104H; L AR 101, 103,
104, 201, 202; MATH 117R/S, 118; PL S 100; RNR 200, 271, 321; SW
200, 201.

Applicants will be evaluated by the Landscape Architecture
Admissions Committee on the basis of the following criteria:
grade-point average, course work, statement of intent, work
experience, special interests, and creative endeavors. Admission
will be restricted to those applicants with the highest
evaluation. It is unlikely that students with cumulative grade-
point averages less than 2.7500 will be admitted. All applicants
to the professional phase will be notified of acceptance or
rejection by May 15. Applicants seeking advanced standing will be
placed in the preprofessional phase until they fulfill all
requirements for admission to the professional major.

The following courses are required as part of the professional
program in landscape architecture: ARH 118, 207 or ARCH 324, 334;

Range Management (RA M)

The major in range management prepares students to begin
professional careers concerned with management of rangelands for
livestock production, wildlife habitat, watershed protection, and
other range resource values. Range management students obtain a
Bachelor of Science in Renewable Natural Resources. The B.S. in
Renewable Natural Resources meets standards for federal
employment as a range conservationist and is accredited by the
Society for Range Management.

Range management majors may tailor their program to career
objectives by selecting appropriate minors and/or elective
courses. Students planning a career in federal or state rangeland
management agencies are advised to select a minor in wildlife
management or watershed management. Those interested in ranch
management, agricultural lending institutions, private
consulting, international development, ranch appraising, or
similar careers should consult the Department of Agricultural and
Resource Economics for a minor in agricultural and resource
economics. Students planning on careers in research or teaching
may wish to emphasize additional basic sciences and mathematics.

of whole watersheds and their multiple uses, qualify the student
for a professional career with resource management agencies.
Emphasis is placed on the use and protection of forests and
rangelands in the Southwest for the critical resources of water,
wildlife habitat, recreation, and other values. Students in
watershed management may select one of several areas of
specialization to further develop their knowledge in physical
hydrology, forest hydrology, rangeland hydrology, soil hydrology,
water quality, or aquatic biology.

Wildlife and Fisheries Science (WFSC)

A major in wildlife and fisheries science prepares the student
for careers that apply ecological sciences for the management and
conservation of fish and wildlife resources. Career opportunities
include positions with state fish and wildlife agencies, federal
wildlife and land management agencies, environmental consulting
firms, and nongovernmental conservation organizations. The major
has two closely related options; fisheries science and wildlife
ecology. Students are encouraged to obtain practical experience
as summer employees, interns, or volunteers with natural resource
management agencies or conservation organizations.

In addition to the requirements for the curriculum in natural
resources, the following courses are required for both options in
