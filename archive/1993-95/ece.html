The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the
College of Engineering and Mines offers the degrees of Bachelor
of Science in Electrical Engineering, in Computer Engineering,
and in Optical Engineering, and Master of Science and Doctor of
Philosophy with a major in electrical engineering.

All three of the undergraduate curricula have the goal of
educating immediately productive engineers who are also qualified
to pursue further education as necessary to keep pace with these
rapidly changing areas. The electrical engineering program
prepares students for careers in such areas as electronics,
microelectronics, communications, controls, electromagnetics, and
signal processing. The computer engineering program prepares
students for computer-related careers including microcomputer-
based design, computer-aided VLSI design, computer networks, and
artificial intelligence applications. The optical engineering
program, offered in cooperation with the Optical Sciences Center,
supports careers in areas involving optical design, optical
fabrication and testing, lasers, optical detectors, optical
instrumentation, optical fiber communications, etc. (See the
College of Engineering and Mines section of this catalog for
specific undergraduate program requirements.) 

The department participates in the honors program.
