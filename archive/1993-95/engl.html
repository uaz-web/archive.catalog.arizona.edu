The Department of English offers instruction in language and
literature, leading to the following degrees: Bachelor of Arts
with majors in English and creative writing, Bachelor of Arts in
Education with teaching majors in English and extended English,
Master of Arts with majors in English and English as a second
language, Master of Education with a teaching major in English,
Master of Fine Arts with a major in creative writing, and Doctor
of Philosophy with majors in English and rhetoric, composition
and the teaching of English. For further information regarding
the graduate programs, please see the Graduate Catalog.

Courses are offered in a number of topics which will allow the
undergraduate to experience a wide variety of approaches to and
kinds of literature, develop writing skills, and appreciate the
nature of the language. As well as courses in the traditional
fields of English and American literature, Mexican-American
literature, African-American literature, English
language/linguistics, composition, and creative writing, the
department offers courses in such areas as film and literature,
women's studies, folklore, American Indian studies, fantasy, and
the oral tradition. Students may participate in the study-abroad
program in London. Undergraduate majors in English can expect to
attain writing, organizational, and analytical skills which will
allow them to pursue careers in professional graduate studies in
literature, or in business, law, medicine, and a number of fields
of endeavor which demand these skills.
