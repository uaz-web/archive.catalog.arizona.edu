The interdepartmental program in Neuroscience offers a graduate
program leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree with a major
in neuroscience, as well as a graduate minor in neuroscience. A
Master of Science degree is offered only in rare instances when
students who have already passed the M.S. evaluation requirement
are unable to continue in the doctoral program. The program
comprises faculty members from several departments in the
colleges of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Mines, Medicine,
Nursing, and Pharmacy, as well as the Arizona Research
Laboratories. The members of the Program on Neuroscience are the
principal faculty of the graduate program and thus may serve as
major advisors for students majoring in neuroscience. In
addition, the program fosters research and communication in
interdisciplinary neuroscience throughout the University.
Research interests of the faculty range from molecular mechanisms
of synaptic transmission to human neurological disorders.
Particularly strong clusters of faculty focus upon cognitive
neuroscience, developmental neurobiology, human speech and
hearing, insect neurobiology, neuropeptides, neuropharmacology,
and motor control. Information about the research interests of
the faculty can be obtained from the program office.

Prospective students should consult the Graduate Catalog for
further details.
