The Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences includes the academic
disciplines of pharmaceutical chemistry,
biopharmaceutics/pharmacokinetics, pharmaceutics, and
pharmacognosy. Please consult the College of Pharmacy section of
this catalog for undergraduate admission and degree requirements.

The Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees with a
major in pharmaceutical sciences are available. Concentration
within the major include pharmaceutical chemistry,
biopharmaceutics/pharmacokinetics, pharmaceutics and
pharmacognosy.  For admission and degree requirements, please see
the Graduate Catalog.

A student must be enrolled in the College of Pharmacy before
taking any pharmaceutical science course required in the
professional curriculum, except as approved by the department.

The department participates in the honors program.
