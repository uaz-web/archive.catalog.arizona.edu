The department offers a program leading to the Bachelor of
Science in Agriculture with a major in veterinary science which
prepares students for careers concerned with animal or human
health and welfare, biological or biomedical sciences and
biotechnology or related fields which require scientific-based
academic preparation. Program courses also support the
undergraduate major in microbiology offered through the College
of Agriculture and the graduate program in pathobiology offered
through the Department of Veterinary Science. Students may also
complete preprofessional courses required for application to
professional schools of medicine, veterinary medicine, nursing,
osteopathy, optometry, podiatry, physical or occupational therapy
and dentistry while working towards completion of the major.
Admission to these schools is not guaranteed and depends to a
great extent upon the quality of the student's academic record
and the participation of the schools in the Western Interstate
Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) professional student
exchange program.

Course requirements for the major, in addition to the basic
skills and proficiencies of the general requirements for the
Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (see the College of
Agriculture section of this catalog), include MATH 117R/S, STAT
163, plus 3 additional units; CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b, 241a-
241b, 243a-243b; PHYS 102a-102b, and 180a-180b; ECOL 181R/L and
182; MIC 205 or 420. The major requires BIOC 460; AN S 213 or
ECOL 320; V SC 400a-400b and 495a plus 9 additional units (no
more than 3 units of independent studies and/or internship in V
SC). Highly recommended courses include AN S 315R, 315L, 330,
336, and any animal production courses; MCB 410 and 456 and
additional courses in biological sciences, business or
environmental sciences. A minimum of 18 units of
humanities/social sciences must be completed from a college-
approved list in three of the four general education study areas.
Students should consult a departmental advisor in planning their
programs.
