<pre>Honors Center (HONR)
Slonaker House
(520) 621-6901

The Honors Center provides special opportunities to those
students who demonstrate the highest levels of creativity,
curiosity, maturity, and academic achievement. Responsibility for
the program is shared between academic departments and the Honors
Center. Departments generally assume responsibility for those
courses which are endemic to their respective disciplines while
the Honors Center participates in this joint venture by offering
seminars and colloquia that are broader, often interdisciplinary
in focus, and by exposing students to a variety of noncredit,
cultural opportunities designed to enrich campus life.

In the Schedule of Classes students receive prior to
registration, all honors courses are identified by the suffix &quot;H&quot;
attached to the course number (History 106H) or to a section
designation positioned under the course number (History 106,
section 5H). Honors courses are reserved exclusively for honors
students. 

In order to graduate with honors, a student must:
(1) maintain and graduate with a 3.5 grade-point average,
(2) complete 30 units in university-wide, college, or
departmental honors courses (18 units if entering as a junior or
senior),
(3) complete both semesters of 498H as part of the 30-unit honors
requirement, and
(4) submit a completed honors thesis to the Honors Center prior
to graduation. The format of the program is structured such that
a student can fulfill the academic honors requirements by
enrolling in at least one honors course each semester, plus
completing the required 498H sequence (6 units).

Course offerings sponsored by the Honors Center and the
participating academic departments include, but are not limited
to, those listed below. It is important to note that, in order to
develop an appropriate blend of honors offerings, these courses
may not be offered every semester or year. Students should check
the Schedule of Classes each semester to determine if a specific
course is available.
