The Department of Soil and Water Science provides students with a
broad background in soil science and water quality, with emphasis
on soil-plant-water relationships or environmental aspects of
land and water use. The department offers the Bachelor of Science
in Agriculture, Master of Science, and Doctor of Philosophy
degrees with a major in soil and water science.

All undergraduate students majoring in soil and water science
must satisfy the general education requirements of the College of
Agriculture, and must complete the following courses: CHEM 103a-
103b, 104a-104b; 241a or 322, 323; PHYS 102a, 180a; MCB 181; GEOS
101 or 110; and MATH 123. The University Writing-Emphasis Course
requirement can be met by completion of S W 411, 426, 450, 461 or
470.

A major with an emphasis in soil-plant-water relationships must
complete S W 200, 201, 316, 317, 431; ABE 250 or 404; S W 411,
470.

A major with an emphasis in environmental science must complete S
W 200, 201, 411, 425; AREC 217; POL 481; and two of the
following: S W 431, 450, 453, 470; HWR 250. SW 105, 106 are
recommended but not required for majors with an emphasis in
environmental science.

Students are encouraged to take additional classes in chemistry,
physics, mathematics, biology, and geosciences, as well as
classes in computer science and statistics.

A minor in soil and water science, emphasizing either soil-plant-
water relationships or environmental science, is available to
students from other disciplines. Requirements include S W 200,
201, and three of the following: S W 105 and 106, 316 and 317,
411, 431, and 470. In addition, students must take 6 units (at
least 3 upper-division units) of geosciences, hydrology,
irrigation, or soil and water science.

Courses listed in this department satisfy the 13-unit College of
Agriculture requirement for microbiology undergraduate majors.

The environmental science major is interdisciplinary and leads to
the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science. It is
administered through the Department of Soil and Water Science,
with an advisory committee formed from the Departments of Civil
Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Chemistry, Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology, Economics, Geology, Hydrology and Water
Resources, Soil and Water Science, and Toxicology.

There are four program areas: land and water emphasis, biology
emphasis, environmental health emphasis, environmental
engineering sciences emphasis. The major is a science-oriented
curriculum, and provides a strong background in the chemical,
biological, and physical sciences. The environmental science
major provides students with an understanding of the scientific
processes that affect pollution of land, water and air.

The general education requirements are set by each college. The
degree will allow a student to use the general education
requirements for any college, as long as two conditions are
satisfied: the full requirements for a particular college will be
met, and the additional requirements for environmental science
will be met.

The B.S. in Environmental Science curriculum consists of several
core groupings. The basic sciences and mathematics core includes:
CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b, 241a, 243a, MATH 124, STAT 263, PHYS
102a, MIC 205, and ECOL 181a. The environmental sciences core
includes: S W 405 or CHEM 325/326, S W 493 (internship), AREC
217, POL 481, OSH 486, and three courses selected from advanced
environmental science, toxicology, and regulations. SW 105, 106
are recommended but not required for environmental science
majors. In addition to these two core areas, students select one
of the four emphasis areas described above. Suggested curricula
and course listings are available from the department.
