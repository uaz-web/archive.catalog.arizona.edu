Scientists from various departments comprise the
interdepartmental Program on Cancer Biology which offers programs
leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees
with a major in cancer biology. The curriculum of the cancer
biology graduate program is designed to introduce students to the
body of knowledge that has been derived from experiments on the
production, properties, and therapy of cancer and to assure that
the students have the necessary background in one or more areas
of related fundamental science to enable them to do original
research.

For more information concerning admissions and degree
requirements, see the Graduate Catalog.

505. Eukaryotic DNA Replication (3) [Rpt./1] I 1994-95 Molecular
and biochemical aspects of DNA replication in mammalian cells
will be described in conjunction with discussions of recent
journal articles on selected topics.  Includes the regulation of
S phase within the eukaryotic cell cycle; nuclear organization
during DNA synthesis; DNA replication enzymes; viral, yeast and
embryo models of DNA replication; the initiation of DNA
replication; DNA replication origins and the reconstitution of
DNA replication complexes. P, BIOC 462b. (Identical with BIOC
505, MCB 505, and MBIM 505) Cress

551. Molecular Mechanisms of Carcinogenesis (3) I 1994-95
Physical and chemical carcinogenesis. Special emphasis will be
upon molecular aspects of the interaction of the carcinogenic
agents with mammalian cells and the subsequent mutagenic and
metabolic consequences of such interactions. The topics of
oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation
induced by carcinogens during multi-stage carcinogenesis will be
emphasized. The molecular biology techniques used in the study of
carcinogenesis will also be covered. P, consult program before
enrolling. (Identical with MBIM 551 and RONC 551). Bowden

555. Cancer Biology (3) II 1993-94 Fundamental biological aspects
of neoplastic growth at the organ, cellular, and molecular
levels; emphasis on the etiology, behavior, and therapy of
neoplasms. (Identical with ANAT 555, MEDI 555, MBIM 555 and RONC
555)

589. Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics (3) I 1993-94 Understanding
correlations of molecular biologic/chromosomal change in human
cancer and the role of genetic change in progression and
metastasis of cancer. P, ECOL 320 or MCB 320. (Identical with
GENE 589, MBIM 589 and MCB 589) Martinez
