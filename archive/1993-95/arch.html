Undergraduate Program: The College of Architecture offers a five-
year program leading to the first professional degree, Bachelor
of Architecture. For degree requirements, see the College of
Architecture section of this catalog. In addition to required
architecture and general education courses, electives are taken
in four areas of knowledge: sciences, humanities, business, and
the arts. Open and architecture electives are also required
enabling students to develop an elective concentration.

Graduate Program: The college also offers the Master of
Architecture degree for students with a previous degree in
architecture. See the Graduate Catalog for more information.

Architectural Design Courses (201, 202, 301, 302, 401, 402, 451,
and 452): Design courses deal with buildings, design methods,
building consequences and student development and maturation. The
design sequence begins with 201, an introductory course for all
students enrolled in the professional phase of the college. Early
experiences are involved with an overview of design fundamentals,
methods and vocabulary. Intermediate and advanced design courses
deal with technical and environmental factors that influence
built form, with evaluation and communication of design ideas and
with analysis and planning for large-scale projects. All design
courses stress synthesis and the application of previous course
content and experience to current projects. Student projects may
be retained by the college.
