The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology provides
general and professional education for those intending to pursue
graduate study or for those planning a career in fields where
training in basic or applied organismic, evolutionary and
environmental biology is necessary or desirable. Courses in
population, community and physiological ecology, behavior,
population theory, biogeography, natural history, genetics,
systematics, morphology, and evolution are offered. In addition
to excellent instructional facilities on campus, the department
uses the Marine Biology Station at Puerto Penasco, Sonora,
Mexico; the Southwestern Research Station at Portal, Arizona; the
Boyce-Thompson Arboretum at Superior, Arizona and the Research
Ranch at Elgin, Arizona. It also curates excellent regional
collections of plants and animals.

The department administers the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of
Science degrees with majors in ecology and evolutionary biology
and the Bachelor of Science degree in general biology. The
department also administers advanced degrees, the Master of
Science and Doctor of Philosophy in ecology and evolutionary
biology, and botany.

The major in general biology for the Bachelor of Science degree
provides a broad background covering aspects of molecular,
cellular, organismic, physiological, ecological, and evolutionary
biology. The requirements are: 181R, 182, 302, 304, 320; MCB 410
or BIOC 460 or 462a and additional upper-division units to a
minimum of 35 in the major. These elective units may be selected
from the departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,
Molecular and Cellular Biology, Microbiology, Biochemistry and
other departments upon the approval of the major advisor. No more
than four of these elective units may be taken as 399 or 499
(independent study).

Also required are courses for a supporting structured minor in
chemistry/physics/mathematics: CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b, 241a-
241b, 243a-243b; PHYS 104a-104b, 180a-180b; MATH 125a-125b.

Within the general biology major, emphases are available in the
following areas: botany, environmental biology, physiology,
zoology, invertebrate zoology, marine biology, predentistry,
premedicine, and other appropriate preprofessional preparation
may be pursued.

The major in ecology and evolutionary biology for the Bachelor of
Science degree is designed primarily for students who plan to
pursue graduate study in ecology and evolutionary biology or a
related science. The requirements for the major are 181R, 182,
302, 304, 320, 435, and at least 12 additional upper-division
units must be selected upon consultation with the major advisor
for a total of 35. These elective courses may be selected from
the departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular
and Cellular Biology, Microbiology, Biochemistry and other
departments upon the approval of the major advisor. No more than
four of these elective units may be taken as 399 or 499
(independent study).

Also required are courses for a supporting structured minor in
chemistry/physics/mathematics: CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b; PHYS
104a-104b, or 110, 116, and 121; MATH 125a-125b, 223 or STAT 263.
At least 6 additional units of mathematics or nonbiological
science are also required. 

The major in ecology and evolutionary biology for the Bachelor of
Arts degree is designed for students with interests in natural
history and the biological sciences who may not wish to continue
with graduate study. The requirements for the major are 181R,
182, 320 and 302 or 304, and 16 upper-division elective units
from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology or from
other appropriate departments with the approval of the major
advisor, totalling 32 units in the major. No more than four of
these elective units may be taken as 399 or 499 (independent
study).

Also required are courses for a supporting structured minor in
Chemistry/Physics/Mathematics are: CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b;
PHYS 102a-102b; MATH 117R/S, 118, and one course from 119, 123,
125a, 263.

Biology secondary education teaching major: The requirements for
the major are 181R, 182, 320 or PL S 312, 401, and a teaching
biology laboratory, for a total of 16 units, and a minimum of 17
additional units of upper division course electives. These
elective units must be selected from the following four subject
matter areas: (1) biological perspectives; (2) cell/molecular;
(3) organismic; (4) ecology/evolution. Three units must be taken
from area 1, with selection of the remaining 14 units from at
least two of the areas 2, 3 or 4. At least one of the courses
must be a laboratory course. The current advisor for the
undergraduate biology teaching major in the Department of Ecology
and Evolutionary Biology will maintain a list of acceptable
courses in each of the four elective areas. Courses currently
available in area 1 are: 421, 479, MCB 404.

The teaching minor: The associated structured minor builds on the
interdisciplinary prerequisite courses implicit in the biology
teaching major and consists of the following courses: CHEM 103a-
103b, 104a-104b, 241a-241b, PHYS 102a-102b, MATH 125a, 263.
