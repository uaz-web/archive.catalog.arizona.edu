Computer science is the body of knowledge dealing with the
design, analysis, implementation, efficiency and application of
algorithmic processes that transform information. The
baccalaureate program prepares students for careers developing
computer applications and computer systems in science and
industry, and prepares students for graduate study in computing.

The department offers the following degree programs: Bachelor of
Science, Master of Science, and Doctor of Philosophy with a major
in computer science. For graduate admission and degree
requirements, consult the Graduate Catalog.

Admission to the major: Students must complete a minimum of 30
pre-major units, of which at least 3 are university credit in
courses for which computer science (C SC) is listed as the home-
department, before applying for admission to the major. Students
should declare Pre-Computer Science as their major while
completing the pre-major requirements. All pre-major units taken
serve to fulfill existing major, minor, or general education
requirements for the B.S. degree. The 30 units include five
required pre-major courses: 115, 227, MATH 124 or 125a, 125b; and
4 units of a department approved laboratory science (as of fall
1992 these include PTYS 106, PHYS 111a, PHYS 110, or CHEM 103a,
104a.) Students typically apply for the computer science major in
their sophomore year. Admission to the major will be selective
and competitive due to limited faculty and laboratory resources.
All students who have completed the pre-major may apply but only
the most qualified applicants will be admitted. Students who do
not have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 and grades of &quot;B&quot; or
better in all required pre-major courses are not likely to be
admitted. To receive a degree in computer science students must
be admitted to the program and complete at least 30 units of
their program as a fully admitted major.

The major: Students must complete the general education
requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences, along with
specified major and minor requirements. The major requirements
total 40 units including: 115, 227, 237, 342, 344, 372, 430, 445
or 473, 452 or 453, and nine units of 400-level computer science
electives. The minor requirements total 21 units including MATH
124 or 125a, 125b, 243, and 3 upper-division units of mathematics
electives. The balance of the minor units may be chosen from
mathematics (a mathematics minor) or from an approved computing-
related discipline (a split minor).

The minor in computer science requires a minimum of 20 units in
computer science. The student's major advisor approves the course
selection. Two options have been developed to provide a minor in
computer science. Option one (21 units) includes 115, 227, 237,
MATH 243, 342 and one of the following: 344, 372, 430, or ECE
369. Option two (20 units) includes 115, 227, MATH 243, 342, 344
and one of the following: 445 or 473.

Honors: The department participates in the Honors Program. All
honors students in computer science complete 6 units of 498H and
3 units of the 400-level computer science elective requirement.
