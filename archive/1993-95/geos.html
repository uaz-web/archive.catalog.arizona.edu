Geosciences, or those sciences dealing with the study of the
Earth, incorporate the various fields of study that are
applicable to an understanding of the formation and development
of the chemical, physical, and biological aspects of the Earth.
Academic and research pursuits in the geosciences lead toward a
professional career in solving or helping to solve the current
and projected issues dealing with land use, urban development,
the search for energy sources, water, industrial and commercial
minerals, and questions concerning earth processes involved in
modern geologic studies.

The department offers the following degree programs: Bachelor of
Science in Geosciences with concentrations in geology or
geophysics; and a Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy with
a major in geosciences. For graduate admissions and degree
requirements, consult the Graduate Catalog. The degree of
Bachelor of Science in Education with a teaching major in earth
sciences is available through the College of Education.

The B.S. in Geosciences (geology concentration): In addition to
the requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences, the
following courses are required: GEOS 101, 102, 103, 104, 209,
225, 302, 315, 321, 322, any four 400-level GEOS courses, and a
field program (GEOS 412 and 413, or equivalent), MATH 124 or
125a, 125b, and one additional course from MATH 215, 223, STAT
263 (or STAT 160); CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b; PHYS 110, 116, 121;
C SC 115 (or other approved computer course); plus approved
electives from geosciences and supporting fields to total 131
units.

The B.S. in Geosciences (geophysics concentration): In addition
to the requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences, the
following courses are required: GEOS 101, 102, 103, 104, 209,
302, 321, 322, 412, 416, 420, and 419 or 424 or 432 or 434 or

science course approved by the advisor; plus approved electives
from geosciences and supporting fields to total 131 units.

Students in the B.S. in Education (earth science teaching major)
enroll in the College of Arts and Sciences as a pre-education
major for the freshman and sophomore years. Although students
meet with a pre-education advisor in the College of Education to
outline required course work, they will also be advised in the
Department of Geosciences. Students must apply for admission, and
subsequent transfer, to the College of Education for their junior
and senior years. The required courses include: ASTR 110a; ATMO
171; GEOS 101, 102, 103, 104, and 401, MATH 124, 125a. A minimum
of 12 additional elective units require two courses selected from
GEOS 225, 321, 322, 431, 450, 453 or 478; one course on societal
issues in earth science from GEOS 415, GEOS 473, ATMO 336 or ECOL
206; and one course from ASTR 301, ATMO 300a or 300b, PTYS 403 or
ECOL 302. If either ASTR 301 or ATMO 300a or 300b is chosen, ASTR
110a or ATMO 171, respectively, will be waived from the core
requirement. The teaching minor may be a single minor or a split
minor from chemistry, physics, or biology; a single minor in
mathematics is also acceptable. Students must also satisfy the
College of Arts and Sciences general education requirements and
professional preparation courses in the College of Education.

A variety of geosciences minor options are available to students
in other departments: earth resources, environmental geoscience,
geoarchaeology, geochemistry, geophysics, mineralogy, and
paleontology. A split minor is also an option. An advisor in the
student's field of interest will assist in selecting courses. The
teaching minor requires 20 units of approved earth science
courses, including GEOS 101, 102, 103, 104; ASTR 110a-110b, and
ATMO 171.
