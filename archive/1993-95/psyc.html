The Department of Psychology offers courses designed to provide a
scientific understanding of cognition, emotion, and motivation,
the biological basis of mental life and behavior in the nervous
and endocrine systems, the organization and development of mind
and behavior in the individual, the social basis of mental life
and behavior, and the nature and treatment of psychopathology.

Degrees awarded are the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science,
Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy with a major in
psychology. The master's degree is awarded during doctoral
training; there is no Master of Arts program as such.

All psychology majors must satisfy departmental distribution
requirements by completing one course (3 units) in each of the
following areas: cognition, emotion and motivation (CEM);
psychobiology and neuroscience (PN); and individual and social
processes (ISP). CEM courses include 218, 313, 318, 329, 350,
355, 356, 370, 415, 419, 425, 429, 449, 451, 453, 455, 472, 473,
479, and 488. PN courses are 302, 312, 370, 401, 403, 411, 412,
413, 419, 437, 465, 467, and 478. Courses in the ISP area include
216, 300, 314, 316, 371, 385, 410, 414, 416, 421, 422, 427, 430,
431, 435, 437, 446, 449, 450, 454, 458, 462, 466, 478, and 484.

The major for the B.A.: 36 units of psychology, of which at least
18 units must be in upper-division course work. Majors must take
101, 230, and 290. The remaining 27 units must include at least
one Writing-Emphasis Course numbered over 400, and may include up
to 3 units in 94 series of practicum or 99 series of independent
study.

Students intending to major in psychology are encouraged to
complete 101 in their freshman year, and 230 and 290 by the end
of their sophomore year. In general, 101 is a prerequisite for
courses numbered above 200, and 230 and 290 are prerequisites for
courses numbered above 400; courses numbered 200-399 lay the
foundations for courses numbered 400-499, and should be completed
by the end of the junior year.

The major for the B.S.: 36 units of psychology, distributed as
required for the B.A. In addition, 8 units in a biological
laboratory science; 8 units in chemistry or 8 units in physics
with laboratory; and 6 units of mathematics, including MATH
117R/S and either MATH 119 or 123.

The minor for the B.A. and B.S.: 20 units of psychology, of which
at least 9 units must be in upper-division course work. Minors
must take 101, 230 and 290., and at least one course in each of
the three distribution areas (CEM, PN, and ISP). Alternatively,
as described elsewhere in the General Catalog, minors with 101,
230, and 290 may develop a thematic minor around some particular
topic in psychology.

Students planning to attend graduate school in psychology should
complete 102, 291, 405, and 475, and should consult with an
advisor no later than their sophomore year.

Recommended minors are biological, physical, or social sciences,
philosophy, linguistics, mathematics, or computer science.

The department participates in the Honors program. The Honors
program is designed for psychology majors who intend to continue
into psychology as a career, and will use the Honors program to
enhance their preparation and entrance into graduate and
professional study. Courses 101, 102, 230, 290, 291, 296, 396.
