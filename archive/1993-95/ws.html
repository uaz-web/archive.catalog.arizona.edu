<br>
Women's studies is an interdisciplinary academic program that<br>
offers courses focusing on the new scholarship on women's<br>
experiences and perspectives. The committee offers the Bachelor<br>
of Arts degree with a major in women's studies.<br>
<br>
The major allows students to specialize in courses focusing on<br>
women and to pursue concentrated study in a supporting minor. The<br>
student is required to take 30 credit hours: three required<br>
courses 100, 200 and 305; one 200-level course chosen from 216,<br>
225, 253a, 253b; one course in multi-cultural perspective chosen<br>
from either 406, 465, 468, 469, 485, 489, or 490,; and five other<br>
upper-division women's studies electives, at least one of which<br>
must be a Writing-Emphasis course (see "Writing-Emphasis Courses"<br>
in the Academic Guidelines section of this catalog).<br>
<br>
The minor in women's studies consists of at least 20 units<br>
selected by the student in consultation with the chairperson of<br>
the committee and approved by the student's advisor. Students<br>
with a minor in women's studies are encouraged to take courses<br>
sequentially, beginning with W S 100, then taking intermediate-<br>
level courses, and finishing with a senior seminar.<br>
<br>
A major in women's studies provides a sound liberal arts<br>
preparation for graduate or professional school. It is also<br>
useful for students who wish to pursue careers in journalism,<br>
social work, or administration of affirmative action with an<br>
emphasis on women's issues.<br>
