The Department of Nutritional Sciences provides instructional
programs in all areas of nutrition and food safety. These
programs prepare students for careers in various phases of the
food industry, governmental regulatory and consumer agencies,
health care delivery systems, and for graduate study or
professional schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, physical
therapy or veterinary medicine.

The department offers the degree of Bachelor of Science in
Agriculture with a major in nutritional sciences.

The Master of Science is offered with majors in food science,
dietetics, or nutritional sciences. For admission and degree
requirements, please see the Graduate Catalog.

Curricular Requirements:
Undergraduate majors must complete the general education
requirements as described in the College of Agriculture section
of this catalog. Courses in four of the five required study areas
must be selected from a departmentally approved list. Consult a
departmental advisor for details.

The major in nutritional sciences: Students are required to
complete the following courses for the major--ENGL 101, 102 or
103H, 104H; 308; COMM 100, 102; MATH 117R/S; MIS 111 or PL S 220;
