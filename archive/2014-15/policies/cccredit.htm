<h4 align="center">Credits from Community Colleges</h4>
  <p>While there is no limit to the total number of units of course work that
  may be transferred from an accredited community college to The University of
  Arizona, no more than 64 of those units may be applied toward the requirements
  for a bachelor'sdegree. The choice of the 64 units is at the discretion of
  the student in consultation with an advisor.</p>
  <p>Transfer students are encouraged to complete freshman and sophomore level
  general education course work at their community colleges. Transferability of
  courses of independent study, internship, or practicum will be determined by
  the appropriate department or college at The University of Arizona and may be
  restricted both in number of units and in degree applicability. Students who
  have taken community college courses in these categories may petition for an
  exception.</p>
  <p>While all courses offered for transfer will be accepted by the University
  according to these rules, the specific lower-division requirements of various
  curricula vary widely. In order to complete the baccalaureate program in the
  normal time span, the student should consult the appropriate college and the
  advisor in the appropriate university department to determine requirements of
  a particular program.</p>
  <p>Community college courses which are equivalent in content to university
  upper-division courses (course numbers 300-499) will be transferable as
  equivalents, but with lower-division credit. These courses need not be
  repeated at the University, but will not count toward the required number of
  upper-division credit hours.</p>
