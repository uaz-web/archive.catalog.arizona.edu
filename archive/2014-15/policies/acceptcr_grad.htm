<p>Graduate courses completed at another regionally accredited college or 
university (or a recognized foreign institution) may be transferred to the University of Arizona and applied toward a 
graduate degree program, provided that these criteria are met:
		<ul>
			<li>The course earned graduate credit at the home institution and is 
			comparable to University of Arizona graduate level work;</li>
			<li>The student earned a grade of A or B in the course (or the 
			equivalent, if another grading system were used);</li>
			<li>The course was not applied toward an undergraduate degree; and</li>
			<li>The major or minor advisor and program director approve the acceptance of the transfer course(s).</li>
		</ul>
		Transfer course work is not computed in the University of Arizona 
		grade-point-average (GPA).<p>
For master's degree programs, no more than 20% of the required units for the 
	degree can be transfer units (e.g., a student in a 36-unit degree program 
	may use no more than 7 transfer units).&nbsp; A student in a graduate 
	certificate program should check the transfer unit limit for that specific 
	certificate; some certificate programs do not allow any transfer credit.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>
	There are also limits on the use of UA courses (400-level or above) taken as 
	a non-degree seeking graduate student or as an undergraduate senior.&nbsp; 
	For specific limits, students should consult the credit requirements policy 
	of the <a href="http://grad.arizona.edu/academics/program-requirements">
	degree program</a> in question.&nbsp; <strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp; Effective 
	for students admitted to a graduate program in Fall 2014, no 400-level 
	courses can be applied toward a graduate program.</p>
<p>
Students who wish to transfer course work toward a UA graduate program must 
submit an <img src="../images/globe-external.gif" width="15" height="16"><a href="http://grad.arizona.edu/system/files/TransferCreditForm.pdf">Evaluation of Transfer Credit</a> form 
in UA GradPath to have transfer course work evaluated for eligibility. This 
should be done before the 
end of their first year of graduate study.
