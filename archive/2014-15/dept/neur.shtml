  <p>Neurology is that discipline of medicine responsible for the diagnosis and
  treatment of diseases of the human nervous system. Courses are offered which
  are designed to teach students to interpret evidence of normal or abnormal
  neurologic functioning, to manage straightforward problems, and to seek
  specialty consultation when it is appropriate. Students have a three-week
  required clerkship, which may be followed with electives in general neurology,
  as well as its subspecialties. Students receive an introduction to neurology
  during lectures in the neuroscience course during the basic science years.</p>
  <p>A continuing neuroscience seminar series is presented by neurologists and
  basic scientists throughout the year. This series is open to medical students
  as well as to postgraduate trainees and students in allied areas.</p>
