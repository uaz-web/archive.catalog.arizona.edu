  <p><b><a name="Graduation"><font size="3">Graduation</font></a><font size="3"> Average</font></b></p>

  <p>A graduation average of 2.000 for all University Credit course work
  undertaken and for any work satisfied by the Special Examination for Grade is
  required for the bachelor's degree. Note: The graduation grade average is
  based only on <a href="definiti.htm#University Credit"> University Credit</a> 
	grades awarded prior to the graduation date, when all degree requirements 
	have been satisfied.</p>
  <p><b><a name="Major"><font size="3">Major</font></a><font size="3"> Average and University Credit Requirement</font></b></p>
<p>Majors for undergraduate degrees require a 2.000 or better grade point
average (GPA) for all University Credit work in the major as defined on the
Academic Advisement Report or for any work in the major
satisfied by the Special Examination for Grade. All grades for repeated courses
will be calculated in the major GPA, with the exception of grades that have been
replaced by the Grade Replacement Opportunity (GRO) and those removed from the
grade point average through Academic Renewal.</p>
<p>Major-related course work should include no fewer than 18 units of University
Credit. Major-related course work is defined as the major, pre-major, supporting
course work, and/or professional core. This requirement applies to all majors in
the student's academic program.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">For Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of 
Science (BS) Degrees offered in the  
College of Humanities and College of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, no more than 
48 units in the major discipline may be applied toward the degree.&nbsp; Excluded 
from the 48-unit maximum are first-year English composition, the first year 
(elementary level) of a foreign language, and courses cross-listed with a second 
academic department if the latter is the home department.</span></p>
<p>The double use of courses in the major with other degree requirements is 
subject to University General Education, college, and department policies on 
double dipping.&nbsp; See the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a target="_blank" href="double_use.htm">General Education policy</a> and check with your major 
AND minor advisors for clarification on the double use of any courses.&nbsp; See 
the Catalog's <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">
majors</a> section for a list of approved majors with links to their respective 
requirements.</p>
  <p><b><a name="Averaging"><font size="3">Averaging</font></a><font size="3"> of Grade for Final Non-University Credit Course</font></b></p>
  <p>Students who lack not more than a one-semester course toward the
  fulfillment of curriculum and minimum-graduation-average requirements, may
  apply as the final course to complete the degree, a single one-semester course
  either in residence at another accredited institution or in correspondence
  work through The University of Arizona. The graduation GPA shown on the
  transcript will include the grade from the approved course taken in
  absentia.&nbsp; An anecdotal note will be added to the transcript explaining
  the difference between the graduation GPA and the cumulative GPA, which will
  not reflect the course taken in absentia. Permission must be obtained from the
  academic dean, prior to enrolling for the course, to apply the grade received
  in such a course toward the graduation average. This provision may be applied
  also to the required separate average of 2.000 in the major field if prior
  permission is obtained from the major <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">

  <p><b><font size="3">University <a name="Credit"> Credit</a> Requirement</font></b></p>
  <p>A minimum of 30 units of <a href="definiti.htm#ucredit"> University Credit</a> from The University of Arizona
  is required for the bachelor's degree. It is further required that 18 of the
  final 30 units offered toward the degree be University Credit. Various
  departments have specific University Credit requirements for their majors, and
  students should consult individual <a href="../dept/aaindex.html">departmental
  information</a> sections for this information.</p>
  <p><b><font size="3">Upper-Division <a name="Unit"> Unit</a> Requirement</font></b></p>
  <p>The University of Arizona recognizes both breadth and depth of knowledge as
  important characteristics of a baccalaureate degree. To insure depth of study
  beyond introductory levels, the University has a general policy requiring
  students to complete a minimum of 42 units of upper-division course work for
  graduation. This requirement applies to students graduating under the 1991-93
  catalog or any subsequent catalog. The special requirements of some academic
  programs may necessitate an exception to this requirement. Some degree
  programs require fewer than 42 units of upper-division credit. For current
  information, students should consult their advisors, the <a href="../dept/aaindex.html">department</a>
  which offers their major, or the 
	<a href="http://aprr.web.arizona.edu/data/interface/aprrs-104.html" target="_blank">Academic
  Advisement Report </a>for their major to determine if
  their degree program may require fewer than 42 units of upper-division credit.</p>
<p><b><font size="3"> Elective Credit Maximums</font></b></p>
<p>No more than three (3) Physical Education activity credits and no more than 
three (3) <a href="success_crs.html">
Success Course</a> credits will apply as general elective credit toward a 
bachelor's degree.</p>
  <p><b><a name="Correspondence"><font size="3">Correspondence</font></a><font size="3"> and Credit by Examination Credit Maximums</font></b></p>
  <p>A maximum of 60 units toward a bachelor's degree may be earned through
  correspondence credit and/or <a href="profexam.htm"> credit by examination</a>.</p>
