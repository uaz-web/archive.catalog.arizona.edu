<h4 align="center">Acceptability of Graduate Transfer Credit</h4>

<p>Graduate courses completed at another regionally accredited college or 
university may be transferred to the University of Arizona and applied toward a 
graduate degree program, provided that these criteria are met:
		<ul>
			<li>The student earned a grade of A or B in the course;</li>
			<li>The course content is deemed comparable to a University of 
			Arizona 500-level course or higher;</li>
			<li>The course was not taken by correspondence or through an 
			extension program;</li>
			<li>The course was not applied toward an undergraduate degree; and</li>
			<li>The major advisor approves the acceptance of the transfer course 
			work.</li>
		</ul>
		Transfer course work is not computed in the University of Arizona 
		grade-point-average (GPA).</p>

<p>
For master’s degree programs, no more than 12 units of graduate credit earned as 
an undergraduate senior, while in graduate non-degree status, and/or earned at 
another regionally accredited institution may be applied toward the degree. 
Master’s students may transfer no more than 20% of the total units required for 
the degree.</p>
<p>
Students who wish to transfer course work toward a UA graduate program must 
submit an <img src="../images/globe-external.gif" width="15" height="16"><a href="http://grad.arizona.edu/system/files/TransferCreditForm.pdf">Evaluation of Transfer Credit</a> form to the Graduate College before the 
end of their first year of graduate study.
