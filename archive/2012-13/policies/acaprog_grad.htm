<p align="left"><b><font size="3">Good Standing 
</font></b>
		<p align="left">Good standing status denotes that a student is eligible to continue in or to return to the University.


		<p align="left"><b><font size="3">Academic Progress
</font></b>
		<p align="left">Students enrolled in a graduate degree program must maintain a 3.000 grade-point-average (GPA) and meet their department’s academic progress criteria toward degree completion.  The minimum 3.000 GPA is based on all course work taken for graduate credit, whether or not the courses are offered in satisfaction of the specific requirements for a specific graduate degree.  

<p align="left">Additionally, each department has its own criteria by which a student is evaluated on academic progress. Failure to meet 
those academic progress requirements will result in the student being placed on academic probation by the Dean of the Graduate College.&nbsp;&nbsp;


		<p align="left"><b><font size="3">Probation and Disqualification, Academic</font></b><p align="left">
<strong>Degree Students</strong><p align="left">Graduate students who have less 
than a cumulative 3.000 grade-point-average (GPA) will be placed on academic 
probation.&nbsp; Students on probation are required to meet with their major advisor, discuss the steps 
necessary to remediate the problems that led to probation, and devise a written 
action plan to be submitted to the Graduate College. 


<p align="left">Students whose cumulative GPA is below 3.000 for two consecutive semesters will be 
disqualified from their degree program.&nbsp; Disqualification results in the 
student being blocked from registration.&nbsp; The student's department may 
petition for a one-semester extension of probation if the faculty believes that 
the student has a high probability of returning to good academic standing in one 
semester.&nbsp;


<p align="left">Disqualified students may apply for one of the following:<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left" class="style2">
	<a href="../../2011-12/policies/nondegree.htm">
	Non-degree status</a>, which allows them to continue taking graduate courses 
	as non-degree seeking students, or</p>

	<li>
	<p align="left">
	<a href="../../2011-12/policies/graduate_academic_renewal.htm">
	Academic Renewal</a>, if they wish to apply to a different degree program.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">&nbsp;Students may apply for readmission to a degree program as early as the semester after their 
disqualification, if they achieve a cumulative GPA of at least 3.000 through additional graduate course work. A readmission request must be supported by the head of the major department and approved by the Dean of the Graduate College. There is no guarantee of readmission.


<p align="left"><strong>Certificate Students</strong><p align="left">Students 
who have less than a cumulative 3.000 grade-point-average (GPA) will be placed 
on academic probation.&nbsp; Students whose cumulative GPA is below 3.000 for 
two consecutive semesters will be removed from the certificate program and 
disqualified.&nbsp; Disqualification results in the student being blocked from 
registration.&nbsp; The student's department may petition for a one-semester 
extension of probation if the faculty believes that the student has a high 
probability of returning to good academic standing in one semester.<p align="left">
