    of Medicine Electives Manual</a>.</p>
Faculty members are listed on the department homepage.
    <p>The Department of Surgery is in the <a href="med.html">College
    of Medicine</a>.</p>
  <p>The department provides a broad general exposure to surgery
  during a six-week basic clinical clerkship and a three-week specialty
  clerkship. The basic clerkship stresses preoperative evaluation in the
  emergency and ambulatory settings, proper operating room conduct and
  postoperative management. An awareness of the nature and management of
  surgical disease is developed by case-oriented small group sessions, rounds
  and weekly conferences. The surgery Specialty Clerkship reinforces these basic
  skills by application to specialty areas such as urology, orthopedics, and
  otorhinolaryngology.</p>
  <p>Elective courses in general and specialty surgery and various aspects of
  surgical biology are offered. Increased clinical responsibility is assured on
  hospital services by assigning the elective student to the patient care team.
  Special courses designed around specific clinical activities and research
  programs in the Department of Surgery and other departments are available on
  an individual basis.</p>
  <p>The graduate program in surgical sciences includes hospital training in
  general and specialty surgery with a strong emphasis upon the five-year
  graduate program. It emphasizes training of the clinical surgeon but
  encourages elective surgical study for future community, academic or research
  surgery.</p>
