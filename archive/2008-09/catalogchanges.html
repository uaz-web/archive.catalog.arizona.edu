 a program that reflects unique educational interests and career goals.  The student selects these subject areas,
 each with 21 units, that relate to a common theme.  Two of the three subject areas must be from departments within
 the Colleges of Humanities, Science, and Social and Behavioral Sciences.
 Courses within each subject area must be approved by the departments' major advisor.  During the sophomore or junior year, 
 students submit proposals to University College outlining their intended course of study.  
 In addition to the general IDS option, there are two structured concentrations available:</em></p>
 <p>To:<em> The IDS major was created as an option for students whose academic and career goals are not best served with a traditional major
   and minor. The program allows students to have a custom-designed major, individualized to reflect personal interests, values and needs. 
   It requires at least 21 units in three (3) subject areas. 
   To be approved, a student must demonstrate how these three areas compliment each other to form a coherent “theme” and how these three areas
   better prepare the student for their academic and career goals than a traditional major and minor.</p>
   <p>An IDS application may be submitted after you have completed a minimum of 30 units and must be submitted prior to enrolling in your last 30 units.
