The Immunology block serves as the foundation of immunological concepts and clinical applications.  In the first week, we will focus on key topics such as antigen recognition, lymphocyte development and activation, cytokine activity and functions of innate immunity, T cells and B cells.  Each lecture will highlight clinical applications of immune mechanisms.  Armed with knowledge of the basics, you will be prepared to apply these concepts to immune-mediated diseases in the second half of the block. How does the immune system respond to bacterial or viral infection? How can the immune system be manipulated to treat infection, graft rejection, and auto-immune diseases? Other immune-related diseases include inappropriate immune responses, such as allergy, and insufficient immune responses, such as congenital and acquired immunodeficiency. Recognition and treatment of diseases and conditions related to the immune system will be emphasized because these will be encountered throughout your medical career.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#medical">Medical grades</a> are awarded for this course: S P F K.
