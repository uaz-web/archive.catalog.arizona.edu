 -- Population Genetics
 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; General introductory course on empirical and theoretical population genetics. It will involve two weekly lectures, weekly problem sets, and regular readings from the primary literature.

As much as any field of biology, population genetics has been divided into a theoretical and an empirical branch. However, these two bodies of knowledge are intimately related and this course will cover both in roughly equal amounts. We will discuss the primary forces and processes involved in shaping genetic variation in natural populations (mutation, drift, selection, migration, recombination, mating patterns, population size and population subdivision), methods of measuring genetic variation in nature, and experimental tests of important ideas in population genetics.

 </b>&nbsp;(2 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; Complex diseases (CDs: e.g., asthma, allergy, COPD, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia) are the next major challenge in human biology because they are at the same time unique, common and difficult to decipher. The complexity of CDs lies in their pathogenesis, in which a constellation of environmental and genetic factors interact in intricate ways to alter biological thresholds and response patterns, modifying disease susceptibility. Since both genes and environmental exposures contribute to CDs, the biological pathways involved in CD pathogenesis depend on the genetic background of a given population and the specific environment to which that population is exposed. Hence, asthma, obesity and hypertension in Arizona may not be the same as asthma, obesity and hypertension in Iceland.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular or alternative grades</a> can be awarded for this course: A B C D E or S P C D E.<br><b>Identical to:</b>&nbsp;  CBA 595H; CBA  is home department.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Spring.<!--GENE595H ends-->
