  <p><font size="3"><b>Introduction:</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Arizona International College prepares students for rich
  personal, professional, and civic lives in an increasingly complex and
  integrated world. The College accomplishes this mission in good part through a
  curriculum designed to ensure the development of a global perspective through
  an interdisciplinary study of the Liberal Arts and the improvement of specific
  skills and competencies. </font>AIC is characterized by small classes and
  frequent faculty/student interaction, required service-learning and career
  internships, and a senior capstone project allowing students to integrate
  their undergraduate experience with future educational and/or career goals.</p>
  <p>In summer 1998, Arizona International College became a new college of The
  University of Arizona. Its mission is to provide the state of Arizona with a
  strong four-year Liberal Arts college with a global focus across its
  curriculum. Students at Arizona International College graduate with a Bachelor
  of Arts degree from The University of Arizona.</p>
  <p><b>Admissions Requirements:</b></p>
  <p>Students apply to the University for admission. Entering freshmen must meet
  the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://admissions.arizona.edu/entrance_requirements.html">Admissions
  entrance requirements</a> established by the Arizona Board of Regents for all
  Arizona universities.</p>
  <h2><small><small>Curriculum:</small></small></h2>
  <p>The curriculum at Arizona International College is unique among UA
  colleges. AIC's curriculum design presupposes a close professional and
  personal relationship between students and faculty members, based on a
  contract approach to teaching and learning. After completing a common core
  program, students work with faculty advisors to design an individual course of
  study in one of six areas of concentration. Students also satisfy competency
  requirements in six essential skills, and complete two supervised internships
  in service learning and career preparation. AIC awards the Bachelor of Arts
  degree with a concentration in one of the six major content areas of study.</p>
  <p>AIC students will generally take AIC courses to satisfy degree
  requirements. AIC students may enroll in courses offered by another UA college
  if these courses are first approved by both advisor and student as part of the
  student's learning contract. Students in other UA colleges may enroll in an
  AIC course only with the instructor's and their major advisor's permission,
  and may add AIC courses only during the drop/add period at the beginning of
  the semester.</p>
  <h3><small>Core Curriculum:</small></h3>
  <font size="2">
  <p></font><font size="3">All students begin the core program with an
  introductory course, On Becoming a Fully Educated Person. During their first
  two semesters, AIC students also complete other specified core courses:
  Critical Writing and Communication, Introduction to Global Perspectives,
  Statistical Techniques for Problems of the Modern World, Human Consciousness
  and the Formation of World Views, and First Year Symposium. The core program </font>also
  requires second language study, along with the exploration of the culture and
  political economy of the second language region.<font size="2"></p>
  </font>
  <p><b>Joining AIC:</b></p>
  <p>Current UA students wishing to switch to AIC from another college at the
  university should first consult with an AIC advisor. A student's prior course
  work will be evaluated for its applicability to AIC graduation requirements.
  Students who complete all UA general education requirements will satisfy AIC's
  core requirements. Students who have not completed their UA general education
  program may use their UA courses to meet many AIC core requirements; in such
  cases the applicability of credits will be determined on a course by course
  basis.</p>
  <p>Contact AIC Office of Enrollment and Student Services at (520) 626-0600 to
  schedule an appointment for advising.</p>
  <h3><small>Concentrations:</small></h3>
  <p>In keeping with its commitment to educate students for the 21<sup>st</sup>
  century, AIC allows students to select from six areas of concentration within
  the Liberal Arts. This alternative to traditional majors prepares students for
  a world in which issues in the workplace and in life are rarely contained
  within the parameters of a single discipline. Within the area of study defined
  by a concentration, a student works closely with a faculty advisor to develop
  a unique program of study tied to specific academic and career goals. The six
  concentrations are described below.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Natural Sciences and Mathematics:</b>&nbsp; Natural Sciences and
    Mathematics combines rigorous study of fundamentals in biology, chemistry,
    physics and mathematics with a broad view of how scientific knowledge
    relates to our society. Popular areas of interest include pre-medicine and
    environmental science.</p>
    <p><b>Social Sciences:</b>&nbsp; Social Sciences introduces students to
    disciplines such as psychology, sociology, economics, and political science.
    Using the perspectives offered by scholarship in these areas, students
    develop the skills to analyze contemporary issues like citizenship, poverty,
    diversity, and social conflict at local, national, and global levels. Many
    pre-law and business students follow social science programs.</p>
    <p><b>Humanities:</b>&nbsp; Humanities students grapple with the universal
    questions of who we are and what makes us human. Students explore
    disciplines such as history, philosophy, literature, and religious studies
    to gain an understanding of our disparate cultures, our traditions, and
    where we are headed.</p>
    <p><b>Fine and Performing Arts:</b>&nbsp; Students of Fine and Performing
    Arts learn about traditions and techniques in fields such as art, music,
    theater, dance, and film. Studies in this area emphasize both the
    development of personal creativity and an understanding of art as an
    enduring element of human culture.</p>
    <p><b>Language and Culture: </b>The concentration in Language and Culture
    emphasizes proficiency in a second language as an essential step toward
    experiencing and understanding another culture. Students combine language
    studies with other cultural studies such as the literature, history,
    theater, or music of a country or region. Study abroad, through course work,
    internships, or independent study is an important component of each
    student's program.</p>
    <p><b>Liberal Studies:</b>&nbsp; The Liberal Studies option allows students
    to develop a concentration that spans two or more of the categories above.
    Examples of such programs are sustainable development, women's studies,
    international management and culture, international relations, and
    environmental studies. Students may also design new programs to match
    particular academic interests or career goals.</p>
