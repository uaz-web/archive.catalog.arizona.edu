  <p><font size="3" face="CG Times (WN)">All students are strongly advised to
  meet with a major advisor and a general education advisor at least once a
  year.</font></p>
  <p>Sociology is the study of human society, its origins, functions and
  problems. It focuses on relations among people, groups, organizations, classes
  and cultures. Sociology explores and analyzes issues vital to our personal
  lives, our communities, our nation, and the world. The curriculum in sociology
  is designed to show students the social character of human life and the impact
  of varying forms of social organization on human affairs. Students are
  introduced to the methods by which knowledge is obtained, and may examine the
  results of research on such diverse topics as the family, religion, education,
  politics and crime. The major provides a foundation for careers in many
  professional fields, such as law, criminal justice and social service, and for
  graduate training as a professional sociologist in government, business,
  community agencies, research organizations or educational institutions.</p>
  <p><b>The Major for the B.A.:</b></p>
  <p>Majors follow either a general curriculum or a topical program; each
  provides students with a theoretical overview of the discipline and the
  fundamentals of its research methods and statistics. In addition, all majors
  are required to take course work in each of three thematic areas: (1)
  organizations and institutions, (2) social inequality, and (3) social issues
  and problems.</p>
  <font face="Garamond Antiqua">
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Sociology majors must complete and pass the Upper Division
  Writing Proficiency Exam (UDWPE) prior to enrolling in Sociology Writing
  Emphasis Courses.&nbsp; If a grade of &quot;U&quot; (unsatisfactory) is earned
  on the UDWPE, the student must take further developmental course work in
  writing.</font></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond Antiqua">All students are strongly
  advised to see their </font>Degree / Academic Program Requirements (APRRs) as
  early as possible in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students planning to declare a
  sociology major should discuss their plans with a department advisor. For an
  advising appointment call or visit the Office of Undergraduate Studies, Social
  Sciences 413A, 621-1543.&nbsp; <font face="Garamond Antiqua">The office is
  open five days a week and administers a wide range of programs for
  undergraduate majors.</font></p>
  <font face="Garamond Antiqua"><b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Preparation for Majoring or Minoring in Sociology:</b></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Students who enjoy the greatest success in sociology
  typically have a desire to gain a rigorous, critical awareness about how their
  own life experiences relate to events and issues in the larger world, why
  certain groups have power and others do not, how and why social change occurs,
  and how various social problems such as inequality, crime, and discrimination
  can be improved.&nbsp; The best introductory sociology courses to enroll in
  are SOC 101: Introduction to Sociology, SOC 150: Sociology of Women, and SOC
  260: Ethnic Relations in the United States.</p>
  <b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Undergraduate Scholarships, Awards:</b></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Sociology majors are quite competitive for a number of
  scholarships and awards available through the UA and other organizations.
  These awards include: the Roger Yoshino Award, Lorena DeSanctis McDuff
  Scholarship, Centennial Award, Barbara A. Hesler Award, the College of Arts
  and Sciences' Distinguished Undergraduate Award, the Truman and Rhodes
  Scholarships, Outstanding Senior Awards, Robert E. Baver Memorial Scholarship,
  Thomas E. Campbell Award, Erdean Patterson Scholarship, and the Ruben &amp;
  Myron Winslow Memorial Scholarship. Some scholarships and awards involve cash
  stipends. Most scholarships require an application and letters of
  recommendation from faculty.</font></p>
  <font face="Garamond Antiqua"><b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Research/Internship Opportunities:</b></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The Department offers a variety of special programs and
  individual studies opportunities for its majors, including an extensive career
  internship program, a legislative internship program, the Sociology Club,
  Alpha Kappa Delta Honorary Society, and structured academic/career counseling
  for all majors in Sociology. The Department invites undergraduates to take an
  active part in their own education, and encourages their participation in the
  research and scholarly activities of the faculty. Undergraduates in the
  Department have actively participated in faculty research projects on dispute
  processing, emotions, family dynamics, juvenile delinquency, social movements,
  social policy, and social power.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Sociology undergraduate majors who become professional
  sociologists find a variety of exciting careers in teaching, research, and
  practice. These careers typically require advanced degrees (the M.A. or Ph.D.)
  and are not for everyone. (About 1 in 25 sociology majors at Arizona goes on
  to graduate school in sociology.) Most majors find a variety of rewarding
  careers in government, law, and business. While the sociology major does not
  provide specific training for such careers, it does provide an excellent
  educational background for a variety of professional pursuits.</font></p>
