	<p><strong>Undergraduate Leave of Absence Policy</strong></p>
  <font size="3">
  <p>The Undergraduate Student Leave of Absence assists and encourages students
  to return and graduate after a one or two semester absence from campus.
  Students with this status need not apply for or pay readmission fees, and may
  register for classes during their priority registration period.&nbsp; The
  University grants a Leave of Absence through the student’s College Dean’s
  Office, see the current Catalog for <a href="/policies/current/leavingu.htm#contact">College
  Contacts for Leave of Absence</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Nursing students</b> must follow the procedure for Leave of Absence
      in the College’s Baccalaureate Student Handbook.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>International students</b> leaving the University should contact the
      Center for Global Student Programs at 621-4627.</li>
    <li><b>Students residing in Residence Halls</b> should immediately contact
      the Residence Life Office at 621-6501 or 621-1241.</li>
    <li><b>For students participating in UA-sponsored Study Abroad programs</b>,
      this Leave of Absence is unnecessary and, therefore, unavailable . On the
      other hand, it is appropriate and available to students participating in
      NON-UA-sponsored study abroad programs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The deadline for a completed application to be received (not mailed) in the
  Administration Building, Room 210, from the college dean’s office, is by
  4:00 p.m. on the last regular business day before school starts.&nbsp; Final
  decisions regarding approval or disapproval of Leave of Absence requests will
  not be available until the posting of grades for the semester immediately
  preceding the term for which the leave is requested.&nbsp; Students should
  note that the timing of the final decision depends on the timing of the
  application.&nbsp; Therefore, students may not receive a decision on the
  request for Leave of Absence before the first day of class if their
  application is received just before the opening of classes.&nbsp; Incomplete
  applications will be sent back to the colleges. If the deadline is missed by
  this action, the student will not be eligible for the leave.</p>
  </font><b>
  <p></b><font size="3">To qualify, students must satisfy the following
  criteria:</font><b></p>
  </b>
  <ol type="a">
    <li><font size="3">be registered during the semester immediately prior to
      the beginning of the leave;</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 -- both at the time
      of application for leave and following the posting of grades for the
      semester immediately preceding the term of the requested leave of absence;</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">have their University accounts paid in full, both at the
      time of leave application and following the posting of grades for the
      semester immediately preceding the term of the requested leave of absence;<strong>
      and</strong></font></li>
    <li><font size="3">have no pending disciplinary action.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <font size="3">
  <p>After processing the application, the Registrar’s Office will mail the
  student copy to the student and the college copy to the college.</p>
  <p>Students, when they do not return at the end of the approved leave, must
  apply for readmission and comply with readmission rules.</p>
  <p>While on Leave of Absence, the University:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>reports enrollment status to lenders and loan service entities as
      &quot;not attending&quot; (students are advised to contact their lender(s)
      for repayment information and grace period expiration); <strong>and</strong></li>
    <li>suspends student’s insurance and use of University facilities.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><small>Dismissal from Courses or from the University Policy</small></h3>
  <p>Reprehensible conduct or failure to comply with university regulations may
  result in a student's dismissal from a course or from the University at any
  time. The Dean of Students Office is responsible for this procedure. Such
  action may be posted on the student's academic record. Students suspended from
  the University are denied student privileges during the period of suspension,
  and may not register for correspondence work except with permission of the
  dean of the college in which they have previously registered. They may not
  enroll in Extended University courses, nor establish credit by examination
  during the period of suspension.</p>
  <h3><small>Medical Withdrawal Policy</small></h3>
  <p>Medical withdrawal is initiated from the Student Health Service. Adequate
  medical documentation must be supplied by the student. Students who withdraw
  from the University for medical reasons and who are medically encumbered must
  have their readmission approved by the Student Health Service.</p>
  <h3><small>Retroactive Withdrawal Policy</small></h3>
  <p>Under appropriate circumstances a student may petition for withdrawal after
  completion of classes for a term. If the student has experienced severe
  physical or psychological stress of such nature as to prevent satisfactory
  completion of course work in the semester or term in question, the student may
  petition for retroactive withdrawal for all courses taken that semester or
  term. This petition must be accompanied by adequate documentation and filed
  with the dean of the student's college.</p>
