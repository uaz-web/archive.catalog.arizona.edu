<h2 align="center"><small>Academic Honors and Awards</small></h2>
<blockquote>
  <h2 align="left"><small><small><b>University Academic Honors</b></small></small></h2>
  <p>Honors are bestowed as recognition of outstanding academic achievement and
  as a means to further encourage sound scholarship. They are awarded to every
  undergraduate student attaining the required proficiency. For some awards,
  students also receive plaques and certificates. The University of Arizona
  supports academic achievement and is pleased to recognize and reward
  undergraduate students whose performance merits special attention. For more
  information see the <a href="../college/hnrs.html">Honors College</a>
  section.</p>
  <p><b>Dean's List
  </b></p>
  <p><font color="#CC0000">(Policy updated June 26, 2003: clarification on how
  students are recognized by their primary
  college.)</font></p>
  <p>Three categories are awarded every semester based on units completed for
  credit and letter grade (excluding all Pass/Fail and &quot;S&quot; grades).
  Also, all grades of &quot;I&quot; must be made up before the honor is
  bestowed.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><i>Dean's List with Distinction</i> -- is based on 15 units and a 4.000
      grade-point average.</li>
    <li><i>Dean's List -- </i>is based on 15 units and a grade-point average of
      3.500-3.999.</li>
    <li><i>Honorable Mention</i> -- is based on 12 units of 3.500 and above
      grade-point average.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Students awarded these academic honors are recognized by their primary <a href="../dept/aaindex.html">college</a>
  (i.e. the college of their first major or their first degree program), either
  at the Honors Convocation the following fall or through other means determined
  by the college.&nbsp; This recognition becomes part of the official record and
  appears on the transcript.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><small><b>Academic Distinction</b></small></h3>
  <p>Two categories are awarded annually based on units completed for credit and
  letter grade (excluding all Pass/Fail and &quot;S&quot; grades). Also, all
  grades of &quot;I&quot; must be made up before the honor is bestowed.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><i>Highest Academic Distinction</i> -- is based on 30 units and a 4.000
      grade-point average.</li>
    <li><i>Academic Distinction</i> -- is based on 30 units and a grade- point
      average of 3.500-3.999.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Students awarded these academic honors are recognized at the Honors
  Convocation the following fall. Those students with a 4.000 grade-point
  average receive plaques. Those students with a 3.500-3.999 grade-point average
  receive certificates.</p>
  <h3><small>Graduation with Academic Distinction</small></h3>
  <p><font color="#CC0000">(Policy updated August 25, 2003: reference to
  graduates with the Juris Doctor Degree deleted per request of the College of
  Law.)</font></p>
  <p>Three categories are awarded for superior scholarship in work leading to
  the bachelor's degree. This honor, based upon graduation grade-point average,
  becomes part of the official record, is awarded upon graduation and appears on
  the transcript and diploma of the recipient.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><i>Summa Cum Laude</i> -- is awarded to candidates whose grade-point
      average is 3.900 or higher.</li>
    <li><i>Magna Cum Laude</i> -- is awarded to candidates whose grade-point
      average is 3.700-3.899.</li>
    <li><i>Cum Laude</i> -- is awarded to candidates whose grade-point average
      is 3.5000-3.699.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To be eligible for distinction at graduation, bachelor's degree candidates
  must have completed at least 45 graded units with letter grades that carry the
  required grade-point average. Also, in computing the above grade-point
  averages, only work in residence is considered. This policy applies to all
  students graduating in December 1998 or later.</p>
  <h3><small>Graduation with Honors</small></h3>
  <p>Graduation with Honors is bestowed on students who have completed all
  requirements of the University-wide Honors Program. This academic recognition
  becomes part of the official record and is noted on the transcript and diploma
  of the recipient. Honors students also wear a special stole at graduation.</p>
  <h3><small>Other Awards and Honors</small></h3>
  <p>Other awards and honors in recognition of outstanding academic achievement
  are bestowed through the various colleges and departments. Also, colleges and
  departments offer participation in discipline-based honor societies and
  associations. Interested students should contact departmental and college
  advisors.</p>
