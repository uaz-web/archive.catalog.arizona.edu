 Applied Aspects of Program Planning, Implementation and Evaluation II
 </b> (4)  I The purpose of this class will be to expose students to applied aspects of program planning, implementation and evaluation.  Classroom theory must often be adapted in the field to meet real world constraints placed on programs.  Time, money, differing agendas of stakeholders, failure to adhere to protocol, being asked to evaluate after the program has commenced, and failure of community to understand utility of program models are but a few of the factors that require those responsible for planning, implementing and evaluating to be able to "think on their feet".

 Community Assessment and Analysis
 </b> (3)  II This course provides training and experience in community assessment and analysis applicable to public health practice.

With an emphasis on public health surveillance and community diagnosis, students will draw from multiple disciplines to assess health status and its determinants (social, behavioral, and environmental), needs for helath services, and the capacity and resources of local community and its organizations.  Students will also learn to facilitate and evaluate the use of data for decision-making by partnerships, organizations and policy makers.  The course provides the assessment background needed for planning and evaluation, the next course in the series.
