 -- Integrating Planetary Sciences and Astronomy into K-8 Education
 </b> (1)  I II This Freshman Colloquium is intended for students in NATS 102 who are considering K-8 teaching as a future career.  All students who plan to get certified as K-8 teachers at the University of Arizona must take the normal suite of General Education courses (Tier 1 and Tier 2) before they can be considered for the Education Degree Program.  This colloquium is intended to introduce students to activities that parallel the material that they are getting from their NATS 102 classes, as well as methodologies for presenting them in the classroom.  These activities have been classroom tested and are now being used in K-8 classrooms throught the country.  Later in the semester, we will invite classroom teachers to the colloquium to share with the students their real-life experiences using these classroom materials.
