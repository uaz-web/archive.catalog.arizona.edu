<p><font size="3">The department offers two undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Science

with a major in Physics and Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics; the first degree

is offered through Arts and Sciences -- the second is offered through the College of

Engineering and Mines. An atmospheric science option is available for the B.S. degree.

&nbsp; Either of these two degrees would be a good choice for students planning graduate

work in Physics. At the graduate level, the department offers degrees of Master of Science

and Doctor of Philosophy with a major in Physics; for graduate admission and degree

requirements, consult the <i>Graduate Catalog</i>. Bachelor of Science in Education and

Master of Education degrees are available with a teaching major in Physics. </font></p>



<p><font size="3"><i>Undergraduate research:</i> The department strongly encourages its

majors to become involved in research at the undergraduate level. Students may obtain

academic credit for such research either through 482 or independent research credit

499(H). In addition, a theoretical astrophysics concentration is available to Physics

majors. This concentration does not lead to a special degree but is instead an informal

program of advising and research opportunities. Students interested in such research

opportunities should contact their Physics Department academic advisors.</font></p>
