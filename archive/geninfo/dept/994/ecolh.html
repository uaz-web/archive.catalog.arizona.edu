<p>The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology provides general and professional
education for those intending to pursue graduate study or for those planning a career in
fields where training in basic or applied organismic, evolutionary, and environmental
biology is necessary or desirable. Courses are offered in population, community, and
physiological ecology; behavior; population theory; biogeography; natural history;
genetics; systematics; morphology; and evolution. In addition to excellent instructional
facilities on campus, the department uses the Marine Biology Station at Puerto Pe�asco,
Sonora, Mexico; the Southwestern Research Station at Portal, Arizona; the Boyce-Thompson
Arboretum at Superior, Arizona; and the Research Ranch at Elgin, Arizona. It also curates
excellent regional collections of plants and animals. </p>

<p>The department administers the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees with
majors in ecology and evolutionary biology and the Bachelor of Science degree with a major
in general biology. </p>

<p>The department also administers advanced degrees, the Master of Science and Doctor of
Philosophy with majors in ecology and evolutionary biology. Students may choose to
emphasize course work in botany, conservation biology, physiology, zoology, invertebrate
zoology, marine biology, and preprofessional areas.</p>

<p>Middle and high school teachers who desire advanced, specialized training in the
biological sciences to enhance their classroom teaching methods may do so through the
Master of Science in General Biology degree program.Consult the <i>Graduate Catalog</i>
for a complete description of the program and admission procedures. </p>

<p>The department participates in the honors program.
