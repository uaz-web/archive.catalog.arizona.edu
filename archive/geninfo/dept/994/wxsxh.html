<p>The Women's Studies undergradaute program offers students a strong foundation in

feminist thought and action through a sequence of courses that offer multi- and

interdisciplinary approaches to analysis of gender-based oppression. Work in the field

contests the historical, ongoing and pervasive gender-based oppressions within society by

evolving a forum for interdisciplinary work. Students in the undergraduate program have

the opportunity to learn how theoretical issues connect to their own lives, and to develop

a knowledge of feminist actions, theories, and methodologies; a greater understanding of

the diversity of human experience; an understanding of and ability to use

interdisciplinary perspectives; and academic skills for lifelong intellectual growth.

<p>Major requirements include a common core of introductory courses, at least one course

offering a multi-cultural perspective, courses from several areas of study defined by the

department, and a writing emphasis course. For more information about the major, consult

the major's Academic Program Requirements Report (APPR) or contact the department.
