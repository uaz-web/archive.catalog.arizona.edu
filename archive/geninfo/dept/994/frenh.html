<p>The Department of French and Italian offers language instruction at the elementary,

intermediate, and advanced levels. In addition, courses (taught in their respective

languages) are offered in the literature and culture of France and of Italy and in

business French and Italian. Study abroad options include programs in Florence and in

Paris. </p>



<p>Undergraduate majors in French or Italian attain a knowledge of the language and the

culture that can prepare them to teach at the secondary level, to undertake postgraduate

studies in French or Italian or to pursue careers in international business or in the

foreign service. Departmental majors selecting the latter option may combine language

study with a thematic business minor in the College of Business and Public Administration,

concentrating in general business, management, or marketing. This option provides a solid

foundation of marketable skills for careers in international business and finance,

communications and technology, government and administration.</p>
