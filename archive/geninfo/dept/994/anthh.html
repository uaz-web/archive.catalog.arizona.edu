<p>The science of anthropology is the study of human beings, their origins, thought, and

behavior. The Department of Anthropology offers graduate and undergraduate course work in

four subdisciplines: archaeology, physical anthropology, cultural anthropology and

linguistic anthropology; as well as specialized training for field research. Special

internships and independent studies in museology are available through the Arizona State

Museum. The Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology is a center for applied

anthropological research in the American Southwest and similar multicultural and

ecological settings elsewhere in the world. The department cooperates with the Arizona

Health Sciences Center in offering a program in medical anthropology.</p>



<p>All undergraduate majors must take a common set of courses which provide the student

with basic training in all four subdisciplines. The student may then select one of three

programs: (1) a general program requiring upper-division work in each of the four

subdisciplines; (2) a special program that requires upper-division course work in each of

two subdisciplines; or (3) a topical or areal specialization approved by the undergraduate

advisor.</p>
