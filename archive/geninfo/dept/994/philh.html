<h2 align="left"><small>PHILOSOPHY (PHIL)</small></h2>



<p>Philosophy attempts to answer analytic and speculative questions that perplex

reflective people when they examine their basic concepts, goals, and ideals. Some of these

questions arise naturally in the course of work in the various sciences and humanities.

Hence philosophy has a natural border with all other academic disciplines, and lends

itself to joint studies and collaborations. The department encourages a double major in a

related field such as psychology, political science, economics, or linguistics, among

others. Specialized minors in philosophy are available for students planning careers in

law or the health professions. For details, students should consult the philosophy

department's undergraduate advisor.</p>



<p>The undergraduate major includes course work from each of the following groups: (1)

history of ancient philosophy; (2) history of medieval philosophy; (3) history of modern

philosophy; (4) ethics and value theory; (5) metaphysics and epistemology; (6) logic and

language. Advanced work in certain specialized areas within philosophy may require higher

mathematical knowledge. Students preparing to pursue graduate work in these areas should

consult with the undergraduate advisor about appropriate mathematics courses. The

supporting minor should also be chosen after consultation with the undergraduate advisor.
