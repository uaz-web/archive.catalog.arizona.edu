<p><font size="3">The Division of Music, a division of Fine Arts, offers course work
leading to the following degrees: Bachelor of Music with majors in jazz studies, music
education, performance, and composition; Bachelor of Arts in Music; Master of Music;
Doctor of Musical Arts; and Doctor of Philosophy. The Division of Music participates with
the Division of Dance in providing course work for the drama-musical theatre major offered
by the Department of Theatre Arts for the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. The division is a
member of the National Association of Schools of Music, and the requirements for entrance
and graduation as set forth in this catalog are in accordance with the published standards
of that association.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><i>Entrance Requirements:</i> Entrance examinations in musicianship and
the major performance area are required. All freshmen and transfer music majors (except
piano and organ performance majors) must audition for placement in class or group piano
instruction. These courses should be taken concurrently with MUS 120a-120b and 220a-220b.
Students desiring the B.A. in Music or the B.M. with a major other than performance must
meet the requirements for registration in MUSI 181 in their major performance area. B.M.
students majoring in performance must meet the requirements for registration in MUSI 185
in their major performance area. Admission to the 181 level requires minimum performance
skill equivalent to at least two years of recent private study and/or four years of recent
membership in school or community organizations. Admission to the MUSI 185 level requires
a minimum of five years of private study or ensemble/solo experience resulting in
sufficient advancement that the student shows promise of being at a professional level
after completion of four years of undergraduate study. MUSI 180 serves as a remedial
course of study for the student who does not qualify for MUSI 181, but who possesses good
basic playing skills and music comprehension. Enrollment is contingent upon audition and
availability. Detailed information regarding entrance and degree requirements is available
from the Director of the Division of Music.</font>
