<h2 align="center">HYDROLOGY AND WATER RESOURCES</h2>

<p align="center"><b>(HWR )</b> </p>

<p>Hydrology and water resources include the origin, distribution, and properties of the
waters of the Earth, as well as the development and management of water resource systems
for multiple purposes. The faculty offers competence in hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry,
environmental hydrology, ground-water and surface-water hydrology, hydrometeorology,
hydroclimatology, water quality, mathematical and statistical methods in hydrology
(including numerical modeling), and water resources engineering, planning, management and
administration. </p>

<p>The department offers the Bachelor of Science in Hydrology and the Master of Science
and Doctor of Philosophy degrees with majors in both hydrology and in water resources
administration. The undergraduate major in hydrology assumes substantial knowledge of
mathematics. For information regarding graduate degrees, please see the <i>Graduate
Catalog</i>. </p>

<p>The department participates in the honors program. Honors students complete an approved
senior honors thesis in lieu of the senior internship practicum sequence. </p>

<h3><a name="deg">BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN HYDROLOGY </a></h3>

<p><a name="deg"><font size="3"><br>
<br>
Hydrology, the science of water, deals with the origin, distribution, and the physical,
chemical and biological properties of the waters of the Earth. It has application to
flood, drought, and weather-related hazards, water supply, recreation, the design of
bridges and dams, pollution control, and other water management concerns. The hydrology
curriculum is designed to give the student a basic knowledge of hydrology and allied
subjects, including hydrologic modeling with computer applications. Flexibility is offered
through the selection of humanities/social sciences, technical, and general electivesso
that a program of study can be developed which best fits the student's needs.
Specialization options: Technical electives can be used to obtain specialization in the
areas of hydrometerology, hydrogeology, environmental chemistry, environmental hydrology,
water resources engineering, water resources engineering-systems, and water resources
engineering-policy. Students should consult with the department regarding development of
these options.<br>
<br>
Graduates with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Hydrology obtain professional
positions in the fields of hydrology and water resources. Because hydrology is a natural
science, instruction is augmented at all levels with field trips in Arizona, a statewhich
contains a great diversity of topographic and geologic features and climatic zones, making
it a superb outdoor laboratory. The field course and an internship/practicum sequence
provide direct experience with hydrologic measurements, testing, and data gathering.
Students apply these techniques at field sites and in research</font></a>
