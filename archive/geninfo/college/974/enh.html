<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>Engineering education is preparation for a professional career. While most
graduates embark on careers in engineering practice, men and women with
engineering majors find the baccalaureate program excellent preparation for
other fields as diverse as law, medicine, business and government. An
engineering education develops analytical and quantitative thinking, a critical
but optimistic approach to problem solving, and the habit of self-directed
future learning. Graduates make successful transitions to a wide variety of
different careers. The graduate has a thorough understanding of how materials,
energy, and information can be adapted to humanity's needs and desires. This is
developed through the study of physical science, mathematics, engineering
science, engineering design, humanities, social science and practice.</p>
<h3><a name="Admissions">Entrance Requirements</a></h3>
<p><font size="3">In addition to University admission requirements, applicants
are required to present 1/2 unit of trigonomietry. It is strongly recommended
that one unit of physics and one unit of chemistry be presented. Students
transferring into the college must have cumulative grade-point averages of 2.500
for all previous college work. Applicants must be ranked in the upper 25 percent
of the high school graduating class; or have achieved a grade-point average of
3.0 on a 4.0 scale; or a composite score of 23 (24 for out-of-state applicants)
on the ACT; or a minimum combined score of 1050 on the SAT.</font></p>

</ol>
<p>Inquiries should be directed to: Dr. Dunbar Birnie, College of Engineering
and Mines, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721. Applications for the
University Honors Program can be obtained from the Honors Program, Slonaker
Building, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721. Freshman honors students
are strongly encouraged to register for ENGR 196a and 196b.</p>
<h3>Minimum Requirements for Completion of the Bachelor's Degree</h3>
<p>Engineering students are subject to the minimum requirements for graduation
defined in the general policies section of this manual. Engineering The
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is the official agency
for accrediting undergraduate engineering degrees. These requirements are
integrated into the curricula that are specified for each engineering degree.
For more information about ABET requirements, contact the Office of Academic
Affairs at 621-6032.</p>
<h3>Accreditation and the Curricular Content Required<br>
for Engineering Degrees</h3>
<p>The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is the official
agency for accrediting undergraduate engineering degrees. As part of the
required curricular content, every engineering student must complete a minimum
of 16 units of engineering design, 32 units of engineering science, and 16 units
of humanities and social sciences courses. These requirements are integrated
into the curricula that are specified on the following pages for each
engineering degree.</p>
<h4>Engineering Design (ED)</h4>
<p>Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component,or process
to meet desired needs. It is a decision-making process in which resources are
converted optimally to meet stated objectives. ED courses include at least some
of the following features: development of creativity, use of open-ended
problems, development and use of design methodology, formulation of problem
statements and specifications, consideration of alternative solutions,
feasibility considerations, and detailed system descriptions. They may also
include constraints such as economic factors, safety,reliability, aesthetics,
ethics, and social impact.</p>
<h4>Engineering Science (ES)</h4>
<p>The engineering sciences have their roots in mathematics and basic sciences,
but carry knowledge toward creative application. These studies provide a bridge
between the sciences and engineering practice. At least one ES course must be
taken outside of the department of the major.</p>
<h4>Humanities and Social Science (HSS)</h4>
<p>The humanities are the branches of knowledge concerned with the culture and
values of the human race, and the social sciences are studies of individual
relationships in and to society. HSS studies assist in meeting the objective of
a broad education and in meeting the objectives of the engineering profession.
In the interests of making engineers fully aware of their social
responsibilities and better able to consider related factors in the
decision-making processes, HSS course work is required as an integral part of
the engineering program. The HSS requirements must also be met by students
majoring in engineering mathematics, engineering physics, and hydrology.</p>
<h3>Scholarships</h3>
<p>A limited number of scholarships are recommended each year by departments
within the College of Engineering and Mines. Students interested in applying for
these scholarships should contact their departmental offices for information. It
is usually best to do this prior to March 1.</p>
<h3>Student Professional and Honorary Societies</h3>
<p>Contact departmental or college offices for information.</p>
<h3>Minority Engineering Program</h3>
<p>The Minority Engineering Program (MEP) is an academically-based student
support program for ethnic minorities and women. For additional information,
please contact Edmund Tellez, MEP Director, (520) 621-8103 or visit the MEP
office in the Engineering Building, Room 212.</p>
