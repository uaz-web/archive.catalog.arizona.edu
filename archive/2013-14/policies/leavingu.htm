  <p><b><a name="withdrawal">Complete Withdrawal from the University</a></b></p>
<p>A 
complete withdrawal from the University is defined as leaving the University by dropping 
all classes after having paid registration fees. 
This option only applies to the Fall and Spring 
(regular) Semesters.&nbsp; During the regular semester, s<span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">tudents 
are allowed seven days to complete the withdrawal process after initiating the 
procedure <span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black"> <img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"></span><a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">online 
through the Registrar's Office</a>.&nbsp; Complete withdrawals cannot be 
initiated after the last day of classes of any semester and must be completed 
before the beginning of the final examination period. 
If a student withdraws from all classes before 
the end of the fourth week of the semester, all classes are deleted from the 
student's permanent record for the term.&nbsp; If a student withdraws from the 
University after the fourth week of classes and before the final exam period, 
the faculty member for each course may assign a grade of WP (withdrawal while 
passing) or WF (withdrawal while failing).&nbsp; Grades for a complete withdrawal 
appear on the permanent record but are not included in the student's grade 
average.
Consult the <img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">

  <p><b><a name="Medical">Medical</a> Withdrawal</b></p>
 

  
  <p>Withdrawals filed before the first deadline at the end of the fourth week of classes (Fall and Spring Semesters), result in cancellation of registration in all courses.  Since there is no record of enrollment, the Medical Withdrawal is unnecessary.</p>
  <p>Medical withdrawal after the tuition refund deadline (after the fourth week of classes), should be initiated with the<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"> 
  <a href="http://www.health.arizona.edu/health_services_services_offered.htm">Campus Health Service</a>. Adequate medical documentation from a licensed health care provider in support of the medical withdrawal must be submitted to Campus Health by the student.  Procedures and instructions for completing a medical withdrawal may be obtained from the<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://www.health.arizona.edu/health_services_services_offered.htm">Campus 
  Health Service</a>.</p>
  <p>A student requesting a retroactive medical withdrawal after the last day of classes must attach a signed Medical Withdrawal Form from the Campus Health Service to the petition for a retroactive withdrawal.  Undergraduates must submit a<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"> 
  <a href="http://registrar.arizona.edu/petitions/">General Petition</a>  to the University Petition Committee, while graduate students must submit a<img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"> <a href="http://grad.arizona.edu/system/files/petition.pdf">Graduate Petition</a>  to the Graduate College.</p>
  <p><strong>Exception:</strong>  The University offers accelerated, professional and special degree programs that are sometimes supported by outside donors or organizations.  Because of the nature of these programs, students may not be entitled to any refunds of tuition or fees, irrespective of the reason for the withdrawal.  It is the student'sresponsibility to know the terms and conditions of such accelerated or special programs in which they are enrolled.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Students who withdraw
    from the University for medical reasons and who are medically encumbered must
    have their readmission approved by the Campus Health Service.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Dismissal">Dismissal</a> from Courses or from the University</b></p>
  <p>Reprehensible conduct or failure to comply with university regulations may
  result in a student's dismissal from a course or from the University at any
  time. The Dean of Students Office is responsible for this procedure. Such
  action may be posted on the student's academic record. Students suspended from
  the University are denied student privileges during the period of suspension,
  and may not register for correspondence work except with permission of the
  dean of the college in which they have previously registered. They may not
  enroll in UA Outreach College courses, nor establish credit by examination
  during the period of suspension.</p>
