		<p>A senior may
  register for graduate work if recommended by the instructor,&nbsp; head of the department
offering the course and
  approved by the Dean of the Graduate College.  Additionally, juniors in the Honors Program may register for 
  500-level courses for undergraduate Honors credit.  A petition for Undergraduate
Enrollment in Graduate Courses must be filed with the Graduate College at the
time of registration or within 10 days thereafter. The Dean of the Graduate
College will not approve a petition unless the senior has a <a href="gpa.htm"> grade-point-average (GPA)</a>
of 3.000 or better on all <a href="definiti.htm#ucredit">University Credit</a>
and is proceeding toward graduation as directly as possible. Under such a
petition, seniors may enroll in 500-level courses for undergraduate or graduate
credit (not both). Courses numbered at the 600, 700, and 900 levels are not open
to undergraduates.</p>
<p>When academic policy questions arise for undergraduates taking 500-level 
courses, see the <a href="guiding.htm">Guiding Principle on the Application of Graduate or 
Undergraduate Policies.</a></p>
<p>Just as graduate University Credit may be applied toward a bachelor's degree
(as upper division credit) or a graduate degree (as graduate credit), graduate
or professional level credit earned and transferred from another institution may
be applied toward a baccalaureate degree at the UA only if it is not used to
complete a graduate or professional degree at that institution. Professional
degrees include (but are not limited to) such programs as law and medicine.
Students may petition the acceptance of graduate or professional credit by
submitting a Transfer Credit Appeal, along with a letter from the graduate or
professional college stating that the courses in question were not/are not being
applied toward a graduate or professional degree at that institution.</p>
