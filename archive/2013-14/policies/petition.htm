<p><b>Undergraduate</b></p>  
<p>Undergraduate students may petition the University Petitions Committee for
  relief if they believe they deserve redress or exception to university rules,
  regulations, or policies <b> regarding academic affairs</b>, such as extension of
  incomplete grade, choice of catalog, and degree requirements. Petition forms
  may be obtained in the Office of the Registrar or from the college dean. The
  completed form with all relevant facts and supporting evidence is submitted to
  the college dean for recommendation. The dean forwards the petition and
  recommendation to the Office of the Registrar, who then forwards the petition
  to the University Petitions Committee for action. The decision of the
  University Petitions Committee is final.&nbsp; See the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" width="15" height="15">
