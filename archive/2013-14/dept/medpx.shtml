	Doctor of Medicine (MD) Program
		<p><span class="style3">The first two years of the College of Medicine – Phoenix MD 
				program are structured in integrated blocks that focus on organ 
				systems in addition to courses focusing on basic doctoring 
				skills and early exposure to patients. The second two years 
				consist of required clinical clerkships in key disciplines and 
				significant time for elective work. Basic and clinical sciences 
				are interwoven with themes: public health, prevention and 
				population medicine, ethics, biomedical informatics and 
				behavioral science. In addition, other topics are integrated 
				across the curriculum, including cultural competency; aging; 
				interprofessional education; and diagnostics (personalized 
				medicine).<br><br>The first two years of medical school are 
				assessed and graded on a Pass or Fail system. Student anonymity 
				with peers and faculty is a key part of the first two years. The 
				third and fourth years are assessed and graded on an Honors, 
				Pass or Fail system. Learning resource specialists, the 
				Associate Dean for Student Affairs, and the Vice Dean for 
				Academic Affairs will have access to grades in order to identify 
				students at risk of academic difficulty and will decide the best 
				resources for these students to receive the necessary help and 
				will direct the student to those resources.&nbsp; These 
				resources will include the block, course and clerkship 
				directors.
				
				<br><br>Located within 10 miles of the campus, the following teaching 
				hospitals are utilized throughout the four-year curriculum: 
				Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, Maricopa Integrated Health 
				System, Carl T Hayden Veterans Affairs Medical Center, St. 
				Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center and Barrow Neurological 
				Institute, Phoenix Children’s Hospital, Phoenix Baptist 
				Hospital, and Scottsdale Healthcare.&nbsp; Many other clinical 
				venues are utilized for the broad spectrum of training.</span></p>
				
				<p>MD/MPH</p>

	</strong>
				<p>The MD-MPH Dual Degree Program is offered jointly by the 
				College of Medicine - Phoenix and the UA
				<a href="http://publichealth.arizona.edu/">Mel and Enid 
				Zuckerman College of Public Health</a>. The emphasis of the 
				MD-MPH Dual Degree Program is on clinical and public health 
				leadership. It is anticipated that graduates will be leaders in 
				a wide variety of clinical and public health settings. The 
				MD-MPH program is designed to give students an exposure to the 
				public health, prevention and clinical issues they will face, 
				and provide a framework for problem solving and implementing 
				effective health programs. Visit the
				<a href="http://publichealth.arizona.edu/prospective-students/graduate-admissions/how-to-apply">
				MD-MPH web site</a> for more information.</p>
<strong>
				<p>MD/MBA</p>

	</strong>
				<p>The College of Medicine and the
				<a href="http://www.eller.arizona.edu/">Eller College of 
				Management</a> at The University of Arizona have developed a new 
				program that promises to offer medical students a unique dual 
				degree opportunity that combines their interests in both 
				medicine and business. The MD/MBA Program will be five years in 
				length with the first two years in the UA College of Medicine, 
				the third year within the Eller College of Business and the 
				final two years at the UA College of Medicine with a continuing 
				connection to the resources and classes at the Eller College of 
				Management. Visit the
