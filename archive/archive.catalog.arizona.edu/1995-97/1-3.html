<B><A NAME="history"></A>THE UNIVERSITY-A Brief History</B> 
<P>
In 1885-nearly three decades before Arizona became a state-the
thirteenth territorial legislature approved $25,000 for building
The University of Arizona in Tucson. The first classes convened
in 1891, when 32 students and six teachers met in the original
building now known as Old Main.
<P>
The University has developed in accordance with the Act of Congress
of July 2, 1862, known as the Morrill Act. This legislation created
the land-grant colleges and enabled the institution to obtain
federal funds for its original schools of agriculture and mines.
<P>
In its early days, there were more students in the preparatory
department than in the University proper, and the number of University
graduates was never more than ten a year. Then came a decade of
rapid expansion. The territory became a state, high schools multiplied,
and the preparatory department was closed. In 1915, the University
was reorganized as three colleges-the College of Letters, Arts,
and Sciences (later Liberal Arts); the College of Mines and Engineering;
and the College of Agriculture. The Arizona Bureau of Mines was
established the same year.
<P>
In 1922, the College of Education was organized, and in 1925 offerings
in law, originally established in 1915, were organized under the
College of Law. The School of Business and Public Administration,
established within the College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences
in 1934, was reorganized as a separate college in 1944. In 1934
the Department of Home Economics was enlarged to a school within
the College of Agriculture. In 1934 the College of Fine Arts,
including the School of Music, and the Graduate College were established.
In 1940 the Board of Regents reorganized the College of Mines
and Engineering into two separate colleges. In 1967 the School
of Earth Sciences was organized within the College of Mines, and
became the College of Earth Sciences in 1971. In 1947 the School
of Pharmacy was organized within the College of Liberal Arts,
and was given separate status as the College of Pharmacy in 1949.
The Board of Regents in 1956 authorized the establishment of the
School of Nursing as a division of the College of Liberal Arts,
and in 1964 the school became the College of Nursing. The Department
of Architecture in the College of Fine Arts, authorized in 1958,
became the College of Architecture in 1964. The Board of Regents
authorized the College of Medicine in 1961. In 1974 the School
of Renewable Natural Resources was approved as a new unit of the
College of Agriculture. The School of Health-Related Professions
was authorized by the Board of Regents in 1977. In 1982 the College
of Liberal Arts and the College of Fine Arts were reorganized
into the College of Arts and Sciences, which includes the Faculty
of Fine Arts, the Faculty of Humanities, the Faculty of Science,
and the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences. In 1984, the
departments that constituted the former College of Earth Sciences
were reorganized to become part of the College of Arts and Sciences
and the College of Engineering, and the School of Home Economics
was renamed the School of Family and Consumer Resources. In 1985,
the College of Mines combined with the College of Engineering
to become the College of Engineering and Mines.
<P>
The 40-acre campus of the 1890s, then some miles outside Tucson,
has grown to 345 acres and 155 buildings. Its stated purpose remains:
&quot;to provide the inhabitants of this state with the means
of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the various branches of literature,
science, and the arts,&quot; and, insofar as possible, to provide
a technical education adapted to the development of the resources
peculiar to Arizona. The University is maintained by funds appropriated
by the State of Arizona and the United States government, and
by fees and collections including private grants from many sources.<A NAME="organization"></A>

<P>
<B>THE ORGANIZATION OF ACADEMIC RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE UNIVERSITY</B>

<P>
The responsibility for administering the state's public universities
resides with the Arizona Board of Regents. The President of the
University is appointed by the Arizona Board of Regents and serves
as the University's chief executive officer. The Senior Vice President
for Academic Affairs and Provost is the University's chief academic
officer and the Senior Vice President for Business Affairs is
the University's chief fiscal and operations officer. Two vice
presidents and five vice provosts report to the Senior Vice President
for Academic Affairs and Provost.They are the Vice President for
Research; Vice President for Student Affairs; Vice Provost for
Academic Affairs; Vice Provost, College of Agriculture; Vice Provost,
College of Engineering and Mines; Vice Provost for Health Sciences;
and Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs.
<P>
Eleven colleges comprise the academic divisions of the University.
Colleges have principal responsibility for determining degree
requirements, including the general education program required
for each degree. The eleven colleges are the College of Agriculture,
the College of Architecture, the College of Arts and Sciences,
the College of Business and Public Administration, the College
of Education, the College of Engineering and Mines, the College
of Law, the College of Medicine, the College of Nursing, the College
of Pharmacy, and the Graduate College. Arts and Sciences is divided
into Science, Fine Arts, Humanities, and Social and Behavioral
Sciences. Each college and each division within Arts and Sciences
is administered by a dean who has responsibility for academic
programs and policies.
<P>
Within colleges are schools, departments, divisions, or committees
which have direct responsibility for course offerings and for
determination of requirements for majors. The academic programs
offered by the University through its various units are listed
in the chart which follows in this section of the catalog. Course
offerings are listed according to the offering department in the
<I>Departments and Courses of Instruction</I> section of this
catalog.<A NAME="divisions"></A>
