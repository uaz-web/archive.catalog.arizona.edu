<B>ACCOMMODATION OF RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE AND PRACTICE</B> 
<P>
Administrators and faculty members are responsible for reasonable
accommodation of individual religious practices. A refusal to
accommodate is justified only when undue hardship would result
from each alternative of reasonable accommodation.
<P>
Persons wishing clarification of the nature or proper application
of this policy should consult the Office of the Dean of Students
or the Office of the Director of Human Resources, as appropriate
<P>
<A NAME="traveling"></A>.
<P>
<B>THE TRAVELING SCHOLARS PROGRAM</B> 
<P>
The Traveling Scholars Program is designed so students may take
advantage of programs or special resources available at one of
the three state universities which are not available at their
own institution. Any undergraduate student with a 2.5000 grade-point
average or any graduate student with a 3.0000 grade-point average
enrolled at Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University,
or The University of Arizona may be designated a Traveling Scholar
by prior mutual agreement of the appropriate academic authorities
at both the sponsoring and the hosting institution. Additional
information and the application form may be obtained from the
Office of the Registrar.
<P>
<A NAME="wiche"></A>
<P>
<B>WICHE-PROFESSIONAL STUDENT EXCHANGE PROGRAM</B> 
<P>
Financial assistance is available to Arizona residents wishing
to pursue careers in Osteopathy, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine,
Optometry, and Occupational Therapy through the Western Interstate
Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) Professional Student Exchange
Program.
<P>
The Arizona Board of Regents WICHE Program enables Arizona students
to enroll in certain professional programs in other states since
these educational opportunities are not available in Arizona.
The State pays a support fee to the school receiving the student
to help cover the cost of education. The student pays the resident
tuition fee at a public institution or the difference between
the WICHE support fee and the standard tuition at a private school.
<P>
To qualify for the program, applicants must be Arizona residents
for five years prior to commencement of training, and have maintained
average grades. All participants are required to practice in Arizona
one year for each year of support, or repay the State one-half
of all funds expended on their behalf plus interest.
<P>
<A NAME="registrationinfo"></A>
<P>
<B>REGISTRATION INFORMATION AND POLICIES</B> 
<P>
All persons who make use of classroom or laboratory facilities
and/or of faculty time must register and pay tuition and fees.
Graduate students who have previously registered for all of the
credit required for their degrees may enroll for<I> supplementary
registration </I>in order to meet this requirement.
<P>
<I>Note: The University reserves the right to cancel any course
not elected by an adequate number of students.</I> 
<P>
<I>NEW STUDENT ORIENTATION-</I>All new students are encouraged
to attend one of the orientation sessions held during the spring,
summer and fall. These sessions provide placement examination
testing, academic advising, introduction to campus facilities
and services as well as course registration. Detailed information
regarding the programs is sent to new students in their admission
certificate packets.
<P>
<I>REGISTRATION-</I>All persons must register and pay tuition
and fees in order to attend class. Registration periods, with
published dates, are set aside for each semester and summer session.
Complete registration instructions, procedures, and deadlines
for which every student is fully responsible are detailed in the
<I>Schedule of Classes</I>, available on campus prior to the registration
periods. A student is officially registered and eligible to attend
classes only when all procedures have been completed, including
payment of tuition and fees.&nbsp;
<P>
In addition to the basic information regarding registration, the
<I>Schedule of Classes </I>is an essential source document for
the current academic calendar, fee schedule, academic and other
student regulations and procedures, and the final exam schedule,
as well as for the listing of courses to be offered.
<P>
<I>REGISTRATION DEADLINE-</I>Students must be registered by the
end of the first week after the start of classes. No late registrations
will be accepted after the 21st calendar day following the first
day of class. Registration is not complete until registration
fees, and tuition if appropriate, are paid. Failure to pay by
the 21st day will result in the student's not being allowed to
enroll, even if the student has been attending classes. Late registration
after this date will not be accepted unless the student submits
a written appeal to the Registrar and can document extenuating
circumstances such as medical problems (physically incapacitated
and not able to be present), legal problems, or some other academic
commitment which precluded enrolling prior to the 21st day (study
abroad, co-op in absentia registration). See the calendar for
the academic year in the front of this catalog.
<P>
<I>CONFIRMATION OF OFFICIAL REGISTRATION</I>-Each semester the
Office of the Registrar mails students written confirmation of
the courses in which they are officially enrolled. If this official
registration record does not agree with the student's own records,
it is the responsibility of the student to go to the Office of
the Registrar to correct his or her registration. An instructor
has no alternative but to assign a failing grade (&quot;E&quot;)
to a student who has not participated in the course but whose
name appears on the final grade report list.
<P>
<I>LATE PAYMENT AND LATE REGISTRATION FEES-</I>A student who fails
to complete payment of all fees prior to the due date for any
semester or term will be assessed a non-refundable late payment
fee. Students who fail to register prior to the first day of class
will be assessed an additional late registration fee.
<P>
<I>STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL INELIGIBILITY-</I>Students with past-due
debts to The University of Arizona are considered financially
ineligible to register until outstanding debts are paid in full.
<P>
<I>IDENTIFICATION CARDS-</I>All students must have a current official
photo identification card. These establish the student's identity
as a University of Arizona student and authorize access to certain
university facilities. The cards are obtained as part of the registration
process for a fee of $5. Replacement cards cost $10.
<P>
<I>LIMITATION OF REGISTRATION-</I>Should lack of facilities in
courses make it necessary to limit the number of students admitted,
preference will be given to students for whom these courses are
required. Among these, priority is given to graduating seniors
and to students having superior records in prerequisite courses,
respectively.
<P>
<I>TRANSFER TO LESS ADVANCED COURSE-</I>Students unable to meet
satisfactorily the requirements of courses in which they are registered
may be transferred to less advanced courses in the same department
if the head of the department and the instructors approve.
<P>
<I>RELEASE OF INFORMATION-</I>The University complies with all
provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of
1974 dealing with the release of education records. A copy of
The University of Arizona's policy for implementation of the act
is available in the Offices of the Registrar and the Dean of Students.
<P>
<I>RETENTION OF STUDENT RECORDS-</I>The Registrar's Office maintains
a permanent record of academic work completed by each student.
Support documents for the academic records are kept for three
(3) years after the student graduates or date of last enrollment.
After three (3) years, it is assumed that the student accepts
the accuracy of his/her academic record and supporting source
documents are destroyed. Students are strongly advised to check
carefully their academic records each semester. Discrepancies
in the academic record should be reported to the Registrar immediately.
<P>
When a degree has been certified by the Registrar's Office, a
student's academic record may not be altered except in those cases
where a procedural or clerical error has occurred. However, if
the student or the University learns facts that were not known
or would not reasonably have been known within the three (3) year
period, the academic record may be altered and/or the degree may
be revoked.

<I>CHANGE OF REGISTRATION FROM CREDIT TO AUDIT-</I>After the fourth
week of classes, a change in registration in a course from credit
to audit will be permitted only if the student is doing passing
work in that course and receives the approval of the course instructor.
After the tenth week of classes, changes from credit to audit
will be permitted only with permission from the student's college
dean.
<P>
<I>CHANGE OF MAJOR OR COLLEGE-</I>A student may change his or
her major by contacting his or her college dean and completing
the appropriate forms. Students wishing to change colleges must
consult the dean's office of the college to which they wish to
transfer. Change from one college to another is established by
filing a change of college form with the new college. The change
of college will be effective for the current term if filed within
the first four weeks of classes during a regular semester. If
filed after that date, the change of college will be effective
the following semester.

whose records indicate indebtedness to the University.
<P>
<I>BREAKAGE DEPOSIT --<B> </B></I>A breakage deposit may be required

Union's computerized meal plan. It offers students the opportunity
to eat at any of the Union's 19 campus restaurants, and over 200
food and beverage vending machines. In addition to the convenience
of not having to carry cash, students who participate in the All
Aboard Meal Plan are not charged tax on their food purchases.
This constitutes a substantial savings on the actual cost of meals.
The average female student spends $700-$900 per semester; the
average male student spends $900-$1200 per semester.
<P>
In addition to the All Aboard Meal Plan students can establish
a Pocket Money account that offers the same cash free convenience.
Students with Pocket Money accounts are able to access the services
of the Fast Copy Center, Gallagher Theatre (movies), University
Photo Service, Sam's Place (games room), Student Recreation Center
Pro Shop, as well as paying for Residence Hall In-room Phone charges.
<P>
All Aboard and Pocket Money accounts are pre-paid (debit card)
systems. Students access their accounts by presenting their student
identification card. A minimum payment of $25.00 is required to
open an account. Monies deposited in an All Aboard account are
restricted to the purchase of food and beverages.

for the transcript, plus a faxing fee of $3.00 for the first page
and $2.00 for each additional page.
<P>

sent through the mail. Transcripts will not be issued for students
whose records indicate indebtedness to the University.
<P>
<I>BREAKAGE DEPOSIT --<B> </B></I>A breakage deposit may be required
of each student registered for laboratory work in certain departments.

Union's computerized meal plan. It offers students the opportunity
to eat at any of the Union's 19 campus restaurants, and over 200
food and beverage vending machines. In addition to the convenience
of not having to carry cash, students who participate in the All
Aboard Meal Plan are not charged tax on their food purchases.
This constitutes a substantial savings on the actual cost of meals.
The average female student spends $700-$900 per semester; the
average male student spends $900-$1200 per semester.
<P>
In addition to the All Aboard Meal Plan students can establish
a Pocket Money account that offers the same cash free convenience.
Students with Pocket Money accounts are able to access the services
of the Fast Copy Center, Gallagher Theatre (movies), University
Photo Service, Sam's Place (games room), Student Recreation Center
Pro Shop, as well as paying for Residence Hall In-room Phone charges.
<P>
All Aboard and Pocket Money accounts are pre-paid (debit card)
systems. Students access their accounts by presenting their student
identification card. A minimum payment of $25.00 is required to
open an account. Monies deposited in an All Aboard account are
restricted to the purchase of food and beverages.
<P>
<B>REFUNDS OF TUITION AND FEES</B>

in compliance with federal regulations.
