Mathematics forms a foundation for all technical disciplines and
is an excellent preparation for a career or graduate study in
many subjects. The department offers courses in pure mathematics,
applied mathematics, probability and statistics, computational
mathematics, engineering mathematics and mathematics education.
Planned minors in numerous professional fields are available;
interested persons should consult with a Mathematics Department
advisor to help choose the option, minor, and additional course
work that best prepares for their chosen career.
<P>
Mathematics is available as a major for the following degrees:
Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science (College of Arts and
Sciences), Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mathematics (College
of Engineering and Mines), Bachelor of Arts in Education (Elementary
Education-College of Education) and Bachelor of Science in Education
(Secondary Education-College of Education), Master of Arts, Master
of Science, Master of Education and Doctor of Philosophy.
<P>
<I>The major</I> for the B.A. and B.S. consists of a core of basic
courses and one of five possible options. It must include 33 units
in mathematics courses numbered 124 or above. The core courses
are C SC 115, MATH 124 or 125a, 125b, 215, 223, 323, and 355.
Advanced students need not take lower numbered courses.
<P>
Students considering post-graduate studies in mathematics are
urged to take additional 400-level mathematics courses chosen
in consultation with their advisor.
<P>
Students majoring in mathematics whose performance on the upper-division
writing-proficiency examination is unsatisfactory must take ENGL
397a.
<P>
<I>The comprehensive mathematics option:</I> The core above and
413, 415, 424, and 425.

program of the College of Education with a major in mathematics,
a student must have successfully completed the following four
mathematics courses: 124 or 125a, 125b, 223 and 215. Furthermore,

<P>
<I>Prerequisites:</I> Because of the nature of mathematics, the
department recommends that students refrain from enrolling in
any course that carries prerequisites unless those prerequisites
have been completed with a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better. Students
without university credit in the prerequisites for 117R, 117S,
118, 119, 121, 123, 124, 125a will be required to have an appropriate
score on the math readiness test to be enrolled in these courses.
The department strongly recommends that students not enroll in
any prerequisite for courses in which they have already received
credit.
<P>
Students must have proof of having taken the math readiness test
in order to register for mathematics courses numbered below 125b.
Test scores are valid for one year.
