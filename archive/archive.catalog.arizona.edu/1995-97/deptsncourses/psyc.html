<P>
The Department of Psychology offers courses that provide a scientific
understanding of the biological, cognitive and social processes
involved in behavior and mental life, including normal and abnormal
processes.
<P>
Degrees awarded are the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science,
Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy. The master's degree is
awarded during doctoral training; there is no terminal Master
of Arts program.
<P>
<I>The major for the B.A</I>.: Majors must complete 36 units of
psychology, of which at least 18 units must be in upper-division
course work. Everyone is required to take PSYC 101, 230 and 290.
The remaining 27 units must include at least one Writing-Emphasis
Course at the 400 level, and may include up to 3 units in 94 series
of practicum or 99 series of independent study.
<P>
Majors also must satisfy the departmental distribution requirements
by completing at least one course in each of the following three
areas: Psychobiology and Neuroscience (PN); Cognition and Emotion(CEM);
and Individual and Social Processes (ISP).
<P>
PN courses are numbered 300-324 and 400-424, 439, 478.
<P>
CEM courses are numbered 319, 325-349 and 402, 419, 425-449, 461.
<P>
ISP courses are numbered 350-387, 419, 424, 450-487.
<P>
The major in psychology assumes moderate knowledge of mathematics.
Students must complete either MATH 117 or MATH 121 or equivalent.
At present, the psychology department offers an equivalent course,
PSYC 230. Successful completion of PSYC 230 currently fulfills
the math requirement for the B.A. degree. Students intending to
major in psychology are encouraged to complete 101 by the end
of their freshman year, 230 and 290 by the end of their sophomore
year and 300-level courses by the end of their junior year. PSYCH
101 is a prerequisite for all other psychology courses; 300-level
course lay the foundations for courses at the 400 level, and 230
and 290 are prerequisites for courses numbered 400 and above.
<P>
<I>The major for the B.S</I>.: Requirements for the B.S. include
all the requirements for the B.A. listed above. In addition, students
must complete 8 units in a biological laboratory science; 8 units
in chemistry or 8 units in physics with laboratory; and 6 units
of mathematics, including MATH 117R/S or MATH 121 and either MATH
119 or 123.
<P>
<I>The minor</I>: A minor in psychology requires 20 units of psychology,
of which at least 9 units must be in upper-division course work.
Minors must take 101, 230 and 290. In addition, minors must either
take one course in each of the three distribution areas (PN, CE
and ISP), or may develop a thematic minor around some particular
topic in psychology.
<P>
Students planning to attend graduate school in psychology should
major in psychology (either B.A. or B.S), complete PSYC 297a,
489, 490 and should consult with a faculty mentor of their own
choice no later than their sophomore year. Recommended minors
are biological, physical or social sciences, philosophy, linguistics,
mathematics or computer science. Students are also encouraged
to enroll in the honors program.
<P>
The department participates in the Honors program. The Honors
program is especially designed for psychology majors who intend
to continue into psychology as a career, and will use the Honors
program to enhance their preparation and entrance into graduate
and professional study. Courses 101, 230, 297a, 296, 396, 496;
independent study courses 199-499, Preceptorship 491, and Senior
Project 498 are available for Honors credit.
