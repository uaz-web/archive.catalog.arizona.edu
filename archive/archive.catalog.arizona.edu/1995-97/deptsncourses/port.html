The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers courses in language
skills, linguistics, pedagogy, grammar and composition, literature,
and culture. There is an alternate track designed especially for
native speakers of Spanish with courses in language and culture,
culminating in creative writing and a variety of classes in Mexican
and Mexican-American literature. The department provides academic
direction in summer programs in Spanish at the Guadalajara Summer
School in Mexico, in summer and year programs in Spain, and in
Portuguese in a semester program in Fortaleza, Brazil.
<P>
The department offers programs leading to the following degrees:
Bachelor of Arts with a major in Spanish, with a specialization
in either language and culture or in Hispanic language and linguistics;
or the Bachelor of Arts with a major in Portuguese, with a specialization
in language and literature; the Bachelor of Arts in Education
with a teaching major in Spanish; Master of Arts with a major
in Spanish, and an emphasis in either literature or language and
linguistics; the Master of Arts with a major in teaching and teacher
education; and the Doctor of Philosophy with a major in Spanish.
For further information regarding the graduate programs, please
consult the <I>Graduate Catalog</I>.
<P>
The Spanish for Native Speakers Program consists of a series of
courses designed for the student who learned Spanish from early
childhood at home or with relatives (as opposed to as a second
language or foreign language in school). The SNS program emphasizes
writing, grammar, speaking skills and cultural awareness. The
SNS courses follow the same requirements for the major and minor
in Spanish with equivalencies as follows: 203=202; 253=251; 323=325;
333=330 and 343=340. Completion of 203 alone fulfills the University's
second language requirement. For more information, contact the
Spanish for Native Speaker coordinator.
<P>
The <I>major in Spanish for the B.A</I>. shall consist of 36 upper-division
units, consisting of two qualifying courses of 3 units each, 323/325
and 330/333, plus 30 upper-division units, with a pri-mary concentration
in either language and linguistics or in language and literature
(eight courses minimum) and a secondary emphasis (two courses
minimum) in the alternate area.
<P>
The major assumes general knowledge of mathematics. Students should
complete MATH 122 or any more advanced mathematics course.
<P>
All Spanish majors will complete 350 and either 340/343 or 452
as part of the program.
<P>
In the language and literature concentration all students will
complete one of the three possible survey courses: 400, 401 or
403 and another Mexican/Mexican-American literature course. The
Senior Thesis in Literature (496a) is an optional course for the
literature major, and is under the direction of a student-selected
faculty mentor. The course will be devoted to the creation of
an original research paper by the student, and is conceived as
an introduction to literary research methods and materials by
the faculty mentor. The complementary language/linguistic component
shall consist of 425 or 450, and either 340/343 or 452.
<P>
Language and linguistics concentration students will complete
340/343, 425 or 450, 452, 453, 457 and one of the culture and
civilization courses (430, 431 or 433), as well as the Seminar
in Linguistics (459), which will vary with the faculty member
teaching the course. This course is designed to be a culminating
synthesis of the coursework in linguistics and to train the student
in research methods and materials. The comple-mentary literature
component shall consist of 350 and one semester of any of the
surveys listed above.
<P>
<I>The</I> <I>major in Portuguese for the B.A</I>. shall consist
of 30 units, beginning with 206 or higher.
<P>
<I>The</I> <I>Interdisciplinary Major in Spanish</I> shall consist
of at least 24 units, of which 12 shall be upper-division, and
shall include 201, 202/203, 251/252, 323/325, 330/333, 340/343
and 350.
<P>
<I>The teaching major for the B.A. in Education</I>: 24 units
in upper-division coursework: 323/325, 330/333, 340/343, 350,
425 or 450, one semester of the literature surveys (400, 401 or
403), one of the cultural surveys (430, 431 or 433) and either
457 or 473.
<P>
<I>The</I> <I>minor in Spanish</I> shall consist of no less than
20 units of work beyond the 102 level, and must include at least
9 units of upper-division coursework, chosed from 323/325, 340/343
and 350.
<P>
<I>The teaching minor for the B.A. in Education</I> shall be the
same as the general minor in Spanish.
<P>
Students will be placed in the proper class level according to
one or more of the following factors: previous experience or study,
departmental placement examinations, individual counseling. Placement
examinations are given during the summer to incoming freshmen
and during the week of registration preceding the fall and the
spring semesters to all students in need of advising or place-ment.
Non-credit proficiency examinations are available during registration
and the first week of classes for students interested in challenging
300-level language courses; no credit or grade is given for this
type of intra-departmental examination. Consult an undergraduate
advisor. For information about proficiency examinations with credit,
consult the <I>Academic Policies and Graduation Requirements</I>
section of this catalog.
<P>
The four-semester language profi-ciency requirement may be satisfied
by completing with a passing grade SPAN 202, 203, 206 or PORT
206. It may also be satisfied by placing in the fifth semester
on the departmental placement exam-ination or through Advanced
Placement examinations. Once a course in a grammar or language-skill
sequence is successfully completed, no lower numbered course taken
subsequently in that sequence will count toward the major.
<P>
<I>Writing-Emphasis Course</I>: Since writing in all upper-division
courses is in either Spanish or Portuguese, the completion of
either 325 or 425 will constitute the fulfillment of a bilingual
proficiency in composition.
<P>
The department participates in the honors program.
