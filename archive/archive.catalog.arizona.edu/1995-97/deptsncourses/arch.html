<I>Undergraduate Program:</I> The College of Architecture offers
a five-year program leading to the first professional degree,
Bachelor of Architecture. For degree requirements, see the <I>College
of Architecture</I> section of this catalog. In addition to required
architecture and general education courses, electives are taken
in four areas of knowledge: sciences, humanities, business, and
the arts. Open and architecture electives are also required enabling
students to develop an elective concentration.
<P>
<I>Graduate Program:</I> The college also offers the Master of
Architecture degree for students with a previous degree in architecture.
See the <I>Graduate Catalog</I> for more information.
<P>
<I>Architectural Design Courses</I> (201, 202, 301, 302, 401,
402, 451, and 452): Design courses deal with buildings, design
methods and building consequences. The design sequence begins
with 201, an introductory course for all students enrolled in
the professional phase of the college. Early experiences are involved
with an overview of design fundamentals, methods and vocabulary.
Intermediate and advanced design courses deal with technical and
environmental factors that influence built form, with evaluation
and communication of design ideas and with analysis and planning
for large-scale projects. All design courses stress synthesis
and the application of previous course content and experience
to current projects. Student projects may be retained by the college.
