Curricula in geography and regional development are designed to
contribute to general education; to provide a substantive and
methodological grounding in geography for those who plan to teach
or pursue graduate work in the field; and to provide preparation
for those persons desiring professional training and/or careers
in such fields as urban and regional planning, land development,
resource management, environmental policy-making, foreign service,
and cartography and remote sensing.
<P>
The degrees of Bachelor of Arts with a major in geography and
Bachelor of Science with a major in regional development are available
through the College of Arts and Sciences and the Bachelor of Arts
in Education, with a teaching major in geography, is available
through the College of Education. In addition, the Master of Arts
and Doctor of Philosophy degrees are offered with a major in geography.
The Master of Science with a major in planning (regional planning
concentration) is offered through the Graduate College for students
wishing professional preparation for careers in planning for urban
and rural regions. For graduate admission and degree requirements,
consult the <I>Graduate Catalog.</I>
<P>
<I>The major in geography:</I> 35 units, including 102a-102b,
103a-103b, 104a-104b, 357; at least 3 units from 330, 381, 417,
418, 457, 481, 483 and REM 490; and at least 3 units from 151,
375, 407, 408, 409, 411, 412, 413, 464, 469 . To complete the
remainder of the 35 minimum required units, students may design
their own concentrations or may select one of four structured
concentrations: geographical applications and methods, people-environment
interaction, urban geography and planning, world regions and cultures.
At least 18 units must be at the upper-division level.
<P>
<I>The major in regional development:</I> 35 units, including
102b, 110 or 301, 305, 371, 379; at least six units from 330,
357, 381, 417, 418, 457, 481, 483; and at least three units from
453, 456, 471. At least 21 units must be at the upper-division
level. A supporting minor in economics, finance, real estate,
marketing, or general business is recommended.
<P>
The department recommends that students take MATH 117, not 122,
to satisfy their General Education requirement in mathematics.
<P>
A maximum of three units of internship (393) may be counted toward
either the major in geography or the major in regional development.
<P>
Interdisciplinary studies majors may elect a geography or regional
development concentration; students may also minor in geography
or regional development.
<P>
<I>The teaching major in geography: </I>30 units, including 151,
497a, at least three units from 102a-102b, and at least four units
from 103a-103b, 104a-104b.
<P>
<I>The teaching minor in geography:</I> 18 to 24 units, depending
upon major and electives, including 151, at least three units
from 102a-102b, and at least four units from 103a-103b, 104a-104b.
497a is strongly recommended.
<P>
The department participates in the honors program.
<P>
<I>Note:</I> 103a-103b and 104a-104b are the only geography courses
which may be applied to the Biological and Physical Sciences Study
Area of the College of Arts and Sciences' general education requirements.
