The under-graduate major is interdis-ciplinary and leads to the
Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Science. It is administered
through the Department of Soil and Water Science, with an advisory
committee formed from the departments of: Civil Engineering and
Engineering Mechanics, Chemistry, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,
Economics, Geology, Hydrology and Water Resources, Soil and Water
Science, and Toxicology.
<P>
There are four program areas: land and water emphasis, biology
emphasis, environmental health emphasis, and environmental engineering
sciences emphasis. The major is a science oriented curriculum,
and provides a strong background in the chemical, biological,
and physical sciences. The environmental sciences major provides
students with an understanding of the scientific processes and
practical applications that affect pollution of land, water, and
air.
<P>
General education requirements are set by each college. The major
will allow a student to use the general education requirements
for any college, as long as two conditions are satisfied: the
full requirements for a particular college will be met, and the
additional requirements for environmental science will be met.
<P>
See the Department of Soil and Water Science for a listing of
course requirements for the B.S. degree in Environmental Science.
