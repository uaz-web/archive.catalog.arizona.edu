Associate Extension Specialist Lawrence M. Sullivan<p>The School
of Renewable Natural Resources is concerned with the management
and conservation of natural ecosystems of arid and semi-arid environments.
Programs of study in the School prepare students for careers in
management with environmental science and natural resource agencies
and organizations that require a fundamental knowledge about the
science, planning and management of natural systems to provide
the resources of water, wood, forage, wildlife, fisheries, soil
and aesthetic values.<p>The Bachelor of Science in Renewable Natural
Resources is available with majors in range management, watershed
management and wildlife and fisheries science. Undergraduate minors
are available in these general areas of study. The degree is composed
of general education and supporting science courses, a series
of interdisciplinary renewable natural resource courses, and courses
that develop additional knowledge in subjects specific to each
major. The natural resource core curriculum is designed to integrate
subjects of importance to all students in renewable natural resource
fields, to introduce students to the interdisciplinary nature
of resource management, and to develop an understanding of multiple-use
management systems. The baccalaureate major in landscape architecture
is not open to new students and will be phased out by summer 1998.
A student may obtain the Master of Landscape Architecture as the
first or second professional degree with a major in landscape
architecture. In addition, a student may obtain the degree of
Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy with a major in range
management, watershed management, wildlife and fisheries science,
or renewable natural resources studies. For information concerning
graduate admission and degree requirements, consult the <I>Graduate
Catalog</I>.

<b>Range Management (RA M)</b><p>The major in range management prepares
students to begin professional careers concerned with management
of rangelands for livestock production, wildlife habitat, watershed
protection, and other range resource values. Range management
students obtain a Bachelor of Science in Renewable Natural Resources.
The B.S. in Renewable Natural Resources meets standards for federal
employment as a range conservationist and is accredited by the
Society for Range Management.<p>Range management majors may tailor
their program to career objectives by selecting appropriate minors
and/or elective courses. Students planning a career in federal
or state rangeland management agencies are advised to select a
minor in wildlife management or watershed management. Those interested
in ranch management, agricultural lending institutions, private
consulting, international development, ranch appraising, or similar
careers should consult the Department of Agricultural and Resource
Economics for a minor in agricultural and resource economics.
Students planning on careers in research or teaching may wish
to emphasize additional basic sciences and mathematics.<p>Required
courses are: ENGL 101, 102, or 103H, 104H; 307 or 308; COMM 100,
102; ECON 201a; AREC 375; MCB 181; ECOL 182; 260 or PL S 360;

330; 477 or 474; RNR 200, 202, 271, 316, 321, 384, 480, 486a-486b;
RA M 382, 436, 446, 456, 487. In addition, students must complete
at least two of the following: RNR 422; PHYS 102a; S W 431; MATH
123; GEOS 101, 103.<p>Students majoring in other fields may take
a minor in range management. Twenty-one units of foundation courses
must be completed before the minor is initiated. Foundation courses
are six units of chemistry, eight units of biological sciences,
S W 200, 201, and STAT 160 or 163. Required courses in the minor
total 15 units and are RNR 384; RNR 202 or RA M 382; RA M 436,
446, and 456. An additional requirement of five credits of upper-division
courses should be selected in consultation with an advisor in
the faculty of range management.

<B>Watershed Management (WS M)</B><p>Watershed management courses,
which consider the management needs of whole watersheds and their
multiple uses, qualify the student for a professional career with
resource management agencies. Emphasis is placed on the use and
protection of forests and rangelands in the Southwest for the
critical resources of water, wildlife habitat, recreation, and
other values. Students in watershed management may select one
of several areas of specialization to further develop their knowledge
in physical hydrology, forest hydrology, rangeland hydrology,
soil hydrology, water quality, or aquatic bio-logy.,p.In addition
to the requirements for the curriculum in natural resources, students
majoring in watershed management must complete: CHEM 103a-103b,
104a-104b; ECON 201a; ENGL 101, 102 or 103H, 104H; 307 or 308;

in one of the defined specializations.<p>Minors are available in
watershed management. Foundation courses consist of prerequisites
to the courses selected for the minor. The minor consists of 20
units including S W 200, 201; RNR 200, 321, 384. The remaining
units may be selected from WS M 408, 410, 460 and 462 in consultation

<B>Wildlife and Fisheries Science (WFSC)</B><p>A major in wildlife
and fisheries science prepares the student for careers that apply
ecological sciences for the management and conservation of fish
and wildlife resources. Career opportunities include positions
with state fish and wildlife agencies, federal wildlife and land
management agencies, environmental consulting firms, and nongovernmental
conservation organizations. The major has two closely related
options; fisheries science and wildlife ecology. Students are
encouraged to obtain practical experience as summer employees,
interns, or volunteers with natural resource management agencies
or conservation organizations.<p>In addition to the requirements
for the curriculum in natural resources, the following courses
are required for both options in wildlife and fisheries science:
CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b, 241a, 243a; ECON 201a; AREC 375; ENGL
101, 102 or 103H, 104H; 307 or 308; MCB 181; ECOL 182; 320 or
AN S 213; PHYS 102a, 180a; S W 200, 201; COMM 100, 102; MATH 123
or 124 or 125a; STAT 160 or 163; RA M 382; RNR 200, 202, 271,
316, 321, 384, 480, 486a-486b; WS M 410; WFSC 444, 446, 448, 455R.
The wildlife ecology option also requires: V SC 400a or 400b;
two courses from WFSC 483, 484, 485. The fisheries science option
also requires: CHEM 241b, 243b; WS M 468; WFSC 441, 455L, 482.A
minor is available in wildlife and fisheries science. Twenty-one
units of foundation courses must be completed before the minor
is initiated. Foundation courses are CHEM 103a-103b, STAT 160
or 163, MCB 181; ECOL 182, and S W 200, 201. Required courses
in the minor are RNR 200, 321, 384 and a minimum of 10 units from
the following: WFSC 441, 444, 446, 455R, 482, 483, 484, 485.
