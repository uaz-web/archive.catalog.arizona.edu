The School of Family and Consumer Resources provides instructional,
research, extension and outreach programs that enable families,
individual family members and consumers to achieve an optimum
quality of life throughout the life-span. Instructional programs
prepare professionals for careers serving families and consumers
in a culturally diverse and rapidly changing society.
<P>
The undergraduate program has as its major objectives: (1) specialization
in various aspects of Family and Consumer Resources, in preparation
for professional positions, and (2) courses to enrich the professional
preparation of students in other colleges.The school is organized
into two divisions, Family Studies and Retailing and Consumer
Studies.
<P>
The school offers the Bachelor of Science in Family and Consumer
Resources with majors in family studies (emphasizing human development,
and interpersonal relations); family and consumer resources; home
economics education; and retailing and consumer studies.
<P>
Graduate degree programs offered by the School of Family and Consumer
Resources include the Master of Science with a major in family
and consumer resources or home economics education; the Master
of Education with a major in family and consumer resources; and
the Master of Home Economics Education with a major in home economics
education. For the Master of Science degree with a major in family
and consumer resources, concentrations are available in family
studies; consumer studies; retailing; and home economics education.
The school also offers the Doctor of Philosophy with a major in
family and consumer resources. Emphases are available in consumer
studies; retailing; human development, interpersonal relationships
and family resource management. For further information, consult
the <I>Graduate Catalog</I>.
<P>
Students enrolled in majors in Family and Consumer Resources may
select a minor subject area with the approval of the student's
advisor.
<P>
<B>Family and Consumer Resources (FCR)</B>
<P>
The major in Family and Consumer Resources combines three disciplines
into a coherent and intellectually challenging major. Designing
the major requires that the student (a) prepare a written proposal,
(b) meet with an advisor, (c) have a final proposal accepted,
and (d) receive an advisor's signature. Each student completes
two subject areas (21 units each) from within FCR. The student
completes a third subject area outside of FCR. All applications
must be submitted to an FCR committee for approval.

S. Shim, <I>Chair</I>
<P>
The major in retailing and consumer studies (RCS) focuses on business
theory and practices of providing consumer products and services
through retail channels with an emphasis on meeting consumer interests
and needs. The major is offered for the Bachelor of Science in
Family and Consumer Resources degree.
<P>
Students in the retailing and consumer studies major study the
whole spectrum of the industry including retailing of fashion
soft goods, food and other consumer goods and services. Three
supplemental, specialized certificate programs are available,
in food retailing, international retailing and visual merchandising.
<P>
Coursework for the major, concentrated in the upper-division portion
of the degree program, focuses on the effective and efficient
delivery of products and services to consumers through four core
components of the program; products and services environment,
business environment, visual and aesthetic environment, and consumer
and global environment.Prior to the upper-division standing, students
are encouraged to complete a basic foundation of general education,
including course work in communications, mathematics, physical
and environmental science, arts, literature and language, the
social and behavioral sciences, and world civilization.
<P>
It is important for students to note that they are required to
meet the advanced upper-division standing requirement (a cumulative
grade-point average of 2.6 or above) in retailing and consumer
studies to establish eligibility for the upper-division level
courses in the major. Also important is to note the advanced standing
requirements (a cumulative grade-point average of 2.75 or above)
required by the College of Business and Public Administration
to es-tablish eligibility for the upper-division level business
courses.
<P>
Any course work that might be applicable to the upper-division
professional core or major requirements taken while enrolled in
other colleges or at other universities is subject to acceptance
by the School of Family and Consumer Resources for degree certification
purposes.
<P>
<I>The major in retailing and consumer studies:</I> Majors must
complete five general education study areas, as described in the
<I>College of Agriculture</I> section of this catalog (see school
advising sheets for specific requirements for study areas); as
well as completing ENGL 101 or 103H; 102 or 104H; COMM 100 and
102 or 112; ENGL 307; MATH 117R/S; FCR 220. Major requirements
include: RCS 114, 115, 284, 304, 310 or 346, 384, 315 or 455;

<P>
<I>Certificate Programs:</I> Under the Southwest Retail Center,
three certificate programs can be completed in conjunction with,
or in addition to , one's major field of study. For information
on the Southwest Retail Center, see the <I>Research and Special
Public Service</I> Units section of this catalog.
<P>
The certificate program in international retailing is designed
to expose students to topics affecting international retail businesses
and to provide a broad understanding of multicultural businesses
and social issues affecting retailers in selected regions of the
world. Students can choose a specialization in one of the following
world regions: Latin America and Mexico, Europe or the Pacific
Rim. The program is designed for retailing and consumer studies
majors and non-majors. Students must have completed a foreign
language prerequisite consisting of a minimum of eight to 10 semester
hours in a foreign language appropriate for one of the three major
world regions identified above.
<P>
The food retailing certificate program is designed to provide
students an opportunity to explore a career in the food retailing
industry. This program is highly recommended for, but not limited
to, students in retailing and consumer studies, agricultural and
resource economics, nutritional sciences and marketing. Students
are encouraged to apply for the program at the beginning of the
second semester of their sophomore year.
<P>
The visual merchandising and display certificate program will
provide retailing and consumer studies majors with the opportunity
to complement their program of study in retailing with a concentration
of creative design courses in art, theater arts and retailing
and consumer studies. This program will prepare students in the
optimum presentation of merchandise. It will be of value and benefit
to those graduates who have responsibility to sell merchandise
or who are concerned about the concept to be sold or the image
to be projected.
