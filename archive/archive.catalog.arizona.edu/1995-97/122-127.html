The Study Abroad Office, a part of the Office of International
Programs, offers opportunities for foreign study on a summer,
semester, or year-long basis. Study Abroad counselors assist students
in choosing a program, gaining admission, selecting classes, planning
housing and transportation and arranging for academic credit.
The office keeps an extensive library of literature and videotapes
on foreign study programs around the world. Costs for programs
vary. Limited financial aid is available through the Study Abroad
Office and foreign institutions; in addition, students qualifying
for financial aid through The University of Arizona (e.g., Federal
grants and loans) can normally apply those funds toward foreign
study programs.
<P>
Historically, foreign study programs centered almost exclusively
on language training and the humanities. That is no longer the
case; a host of other intellectual interests, from economics and
media arts to the natural sciences, can now be pursued through
study abroad programs. Many programs are available in Western
Europe through the Study Abroad Office: England, Spain, France,
Italy, and Denmark are popular des-tinations. Programs also exist
in Russia and Hungary. Additionally, as part of a growing commitment
to offer more opportunities in non-Western arenas, the Study Abroad
Office has expanded its programs in Latin America, the Middle
East and East Asia.

In addition to study abroad programs, the Study Abroad Office
also offers exchange programs with select foreign universities;
exchange programs with a number of universities in Mexico are

The Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) has been an integral
part of The University of Arizona since 1917. The School of Military
Science, Naval Science and Military Aerospace Studies consists
of three separate departments, the Department of Military Science
(Army), Department of Naval Science (Navy and Marine Corps), and
the Department of Military Aerospace Studies (Air Force), under
the administrative control of the military coordinator, a civilian
member of the University staff designated by the President of
the University.
<P>
General objectives of the course of instruction are to furnish
leaders suitable for commissioning as officers in the U.S. Army,
U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Air Force. Outstanding
Army ROTC students who are designated Distinguished Military Students
are eligible to apply for appointment as officers in the Regular
Army. All graduating students in the Air Force ROTC program go
on active duty. Intermediate objectives of the ROTC programs are
to develop self-discipline; integrity; a sense of responsibility;
an appreciation of the role of a participating citizen in the
national defense; and the capacities for thoughtful and decisive
leadership.
<P>
<B>Department of Military Science</B> 
<P>
Army ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) is a program which
offers college students the opportunity to graduate as officers
and serve in the U.S. Army, the Army National Guard, or the U.S.
Army Reserve. Army ROTC has been an integral part of The University
of Arizona since 1917.
<P>
Army ROTC enhances a student's education by providing unique leadership
and management training, along with practical experience. It helps
a student develop many of the qualities basic to success in the
Army, or in a civilian career. ROTC gives each college student
a valuable opportunity to build for the future by earning a college
degree and an officer's commission at the same time.
<P>
<B>Programs</B> 
<P>
The Department of Military Science offers a regular four-year
program and a special two-year program.
<P>
The four-year program is divided into two parts called the Basic
Course and the Advanced Course. The Basic Course is usually taken
during the first two years of college and covers such subjects
as first aid, land navigation, basic rifle marksmanship, and leadership
development. In addition, a variety of outside social and professional
enrichment activities are available. All necessary ROTC textbooks,
uniforms, and other essential materials for the Basic Course are
furnished to the students at no cost. The student participating
in the Basic Course is under no military obligation. After completing
the Basic Course, students who have the desire and have demonstrated
the potential to become an officer and who have met the physical
and scholastic standards are eligible to enroll in the Advanced
Course.
<P>
The Advanced Course is usually taken during the final two years
of college. It includes instruction in organization and management,
tactics, ethics and professionalism and further leadership development.
All necessary textbooks and uniforms in the Advanced Course are
also furnished to students at no cost. During the summer between
their junior and senior years of college, Advanced Course cadets
attend a paid six-week training session at Fort Lewis, Washington,
called ROTC Advanced Camp. Advanced Camp gives cadets the chance
to practice what they've learned in the classroom, and introduces
them to Army life at an active Army post. Advanced Course cadets
receive a monthly subsistence allowance of $100.00 during their
ROTC training.
<P>
The two-year program is designed for junior and community college
graduates, students at four-year colleges who did not take ROTC
during their first two years of school, students entering a two-year
post-graduate course of study, and high school students planning
to attend military junior colleges. To enter the two-year program,
students must first attend a fully-paid six-week Basic Camp, normally
held during the summer between their sophomore and junior years
of college. Students going to a military junior college will attend
camp the summer following high school graduation. At Basic Camp,
students learn to challenge themselves physically and mentally,
and to build their confidence and self-esteem. After successful
completion of Basic Camp, students who meet all the necessary
enrollment requirements may enroll in the Advanced Course of ROTC
study. Students with prior military service may qualify for the
Advanced Program without having to attend Basic Camp.
<P>
<B>Professional Military Education Requirement</B> 
<P>
Prior to commissioning, all cadets must take five professional
military education (PME) courses. Cadets must select one course
from each of the following fields of study: written communications,
human behavior, military history, computers, and mathematics.
The suggested courses serve as a guide to assist cadets. If a
cadet wants to take another course in one of the required fields
or transfer credits from another institution, he or she may do
so. Consult an advisor to ensure all PME requirements are completed.

<B>Department of Naval Science</B> 
<P>
The mission of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps Unit
is to develop midshipmen morally, mentally and physically and
to imbue them with the highest ideals of duty, honor and loyalty
in order to commission college graduates as naval officers who
possess a basic professional background, are motivated toward
careers in the naval service, and have a potential for future
development in mind and character so as to assume the highest
responsibilities of command, citizenship and government.
<P>
<B>Programs</B> 
<P>
The Naval ROTC (NROTC) program is available to eligible high school
seniors, college freshmen, sophomores and juniors. Students progress
through the program as either scholarship midshipmen or nonscholarship,
college program midshipmen. Both programs lead to service as a
commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy or Marine Corps.
<P>
Students interested in either Naval ROTC program may apply at
any point during the year (contact the NROTC office at <BR>
621-1281). Also, college program members of the NROTC battalion
are reviewed and selected for scholarships continually throughout
the year. To become a member of the NROTC program, students must
demonstrate superior academic performance and display outstanding
leadership potential.
<P>
<B>Financial Aid</B> 
<P>
The Naval ROTC program offers financial aid to both scholarship
and college program midshipmen. Students in the NROTC scholarship
program receive full tuition, course fees, books, uniforms and
$100 per month. Additionally, scholarship students are eligible
to receive the financial aid package for two, three, four, or
five years. NROTC college program midshipmen receive Naval Science
textbooks, uniforms, and if qualified, $100 per month during their
junior and senior years.
<P>
Applications for the NROTC four- and five-year scholarship program
must be made to the Navy by December 1 for entry in the program
the following fall semester. The major factors examined during
the application process are ACT/SAT scores, high school and college
academic performance, leadership potential, and extracurricular
activities. Applications for the NROTC two- or three-year scholarship
programs and the nonscholarship, college program must be submitted
through The University of Arizona NROTC Unit. These applications
are accepted year round and are judged on the same criteria as
the four- and five-year scholarship applicants.
<P>
Further information concerning the program may be obtained from
high school and college counselors, local Navy recruiting centers,
and the NROTC unit at The University of Arizona.
<P>
<B>Courses of Instruction</B> 
<P>
Students are encouraged to pursue majors in the engineering and
physical science (mathematics, chemistry, and physics) fields
of study to meet the technological requirements of today's modern
Navy. However, a student may elect to pursue any academic major
provided the midshipman also completes the required Naval Science
curriculum and the Navy-specified college courses outlined below.
<P>
While enrolled in the NROTC program the student will complete
the following Naval Science and University courses in addition
to their academic major requirements.
<P>
<I>First Year</I>

110a-111b; one semester of foreign language; ENGR 101/MIS 111/C
SC 115; and one semester in American Military History or National
Security Policy. College program students have English, mathematics,
computer and physical science requirements, also.
<P>
Course descriptions may be found under Naval Science in the <I>Departments
and Courses of Instruction</I> section of this catalog. Marine
Corps option students will take Naval Science 310, Evolution of
Warfare; Naval Science 410, Amphibious Warfare; and two elective
courses (approved by the Professor of Naval Science) during their
third and fourth years.
<P>
All ROTC students attend Naval Science Leadership Laboratory once
a week. In addition, NROTC scholarship students and senior college
program students attend 4-6 weeks of summer training at various
Naval Stations and ships throughout the world.
<P>
<B>Department of Military Aerospace Studies</B> 
<P>
The Department of Military Aerospace Studies (Air Force ROTC),
provides unique opportunities to students interested in entering
the military profession as Air Force officers. Today's Air Force
is a highly technologically advanced branch of the military forces.
Whether a student's interest lies in flying the most advanced
aircraft in the world or in the development of state-of-the-art
technology, the Air Force can offer exciting and challenging opportunities
to those who qualify. Graduates go on active duty in career fields
where they can immediately apply their university education. Additionally,
they assume advanced leadership and management responsibilities
not normally found in civilian entry-level positions. Although
a bachelor's degree is the minimum requirement, students working
toward higher degrees can also join the program and receive a
commission in the U.S. Air Force.
<P>
<B>Programs</B> 
<P>
Air Force ROTC offers both a two- and four-year program. Both
allow a student to compete for a commission in the United States
Air Force, and they also provide the same mixture of military
academic and leadership studies. The four-year program is generally
recommended, however, due to the increased training provided.
<P>
The four-year program consists of the General Military Course-four
semesters of lower-division aerospace studies classes; and the
Professional Officer Course-four semesters of upper-division aerospace
studies classes. The first four semesters carry no military obligation,
giving students the opportunity to look at the military profession
and the Air Force before making a commitment. Since the first
four semesters have no prerequisites, they are open to any student
interested in exploring Air Force opportunities. Also, a student
may attend the first two semesters concurrently with the second
two semesters, therefore effectively creating a three-year program.
<P>
The two-year program consists of the Professional Officer Course.
Students must have at least a junior standing to enter the two-year
program, but should apply during the fall or early spring of their
sophomore year of study. Seniors and graduate students wishing
to enter the two-year program must be willing to spend two years
in ROTC as full-time students.
<P>
<B>Financial Aid</B> 
<P>
Every student accepted into the Professional Officer Course receives
a $100.00 per month, tax-free subsistence allowance during the
academic year. Scholarships are also available. Air Force ROTC
offers four-, three-, and two-year scholarships. Students must
apply for four-year scholarships as seniors in high school. Subsequent
to high school, students must be enrolled in an Air Force ROTC
class to apply. A student enrolled in any lower-division Air Force
ROTC class may qualify for a scholarship. Scholarships pay tuition
and fees, the cost of books, plus a $100.00 per month, tax-free
subsistence allowance. Scholarships are awarded based on the student's
achievement, not financial need, and do not extend the active
duty commitment.
<P>
<B>Credit</B> 
<P>
Lower-division Air Force ROTC classes carry two units of credit
each semester. Upper-division classes carry three units each semester.For
more information, please contact the Department of Military Aerospace
Studies.
