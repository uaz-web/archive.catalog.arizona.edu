<B>COLLEGE OF ARCHITECTURE</B>
<P>
<B><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</B>
<P>
Architecture is the art and science of building. As a meeting
place of the arts and sciences, it is innately interdisciplinary
and has continuing vitality as a field of study or a life career.
Students of architecture investigate both the broad relationships
between human and natural forces and the relationships between
materials and technologies required to realize architecture as
built form. The college program is organized with the design studio
as the element of focus.
<P>
Today, the architect may be involved with the design of a new
community, a complex of buildings, an individual structure, or
the smallest details of interior space. Architects may also be
involved in programming and pre-design activities, site analysis,
financial feasibility, user needs analysis, management, administration,
and related issues. The College of Architecture prepares students
to participate in this broad spectrum of challenges in the shaping
of our built environment.
<P>
The College of Architecture has an NAAB accredited five-year program.
<P>
<B><A NAME="deg"></A>DEGREES</B> 
<P>
The College of Architecture offers a five-year program leading
to the professional degree, Bachelor of Architecture. The program
is organized around courses in five areas of study: history and
theory, design and communication, technologies, practice and management
and a general education curriculum supported by University electives.
The first year is preprofessional. The professional years are
composed of two parts: a two-year core (the second and third years)
and the fourth and fifth years, which provide opportunities for
design studio options, foreign studies and a senior project. Fourth-
and fifth-year design studio options are offered in desert architecture,
historic preservation, community design, computer-aided design,
building design, design competitions and energy-conscious design.
Offerings vary each year according to faculty availability. New
options may be introduced.
<P>
The College also offers a program of study leading to the Master
of Architecture degree. Areas of particular emphasis in the graduate
program are desert architecture (including technological and cultural
aspects of sustainability) and design communication (including
verbal, graphic and multi-media studies). Two years of full-time
study are normally recommended; however, students with a five-year
Bachelor of Architecture degree from an accredited school of architecture
may be able to complete the degree in less time. See the <I>Graduate
Catalog</I> for additional information.
<P>

<P>
<B>Admissions</B> 
<P>
<I>PREPROFESSIONAL YEAR (FIRST YEAR)</I>-See &quot;Admission to
Particular Colleges, Schools and Programs&quot; in the <I>Admission
to the University</I> section of this catalog. Admission to full
standing in the College of Architecture requires all entering
first-year students to present 15 units of acceptable high school
credit as shown in following chart:
<P>
In some cases, students deficient in one or more of the high school
courses listed above may be permitted to enter the College of
Architecture. Applicants with a deficiency in intermediate algebra
should take MATH 116. All entrance deficiencies must be removed
prior to admission to the professional phase of the program.
<P>
Applicants are advised to include among their electives additional
courses in mathematics, such as trigonometry and advanced algebra.
<P>
Students who have made a decision to pursue professional education
in architecture are strongly advised to seek admission to the
College of Architecture at their first opportunity in order to
minimize the time required to complete the professional degree.
<P>
Students in the preprofessional year may not enroll in required
professional phase courses except upon petition to the Student
Affairs Committee. Preprofessional students may, however, enroll
in some architecture elective courses.<HR>

404, 414, 424, 434, 464, 466 and selected courses from other colleges.
Contact the College of Architecture for a list of the approved
courses.</I> 
<P>
<B><A NAME="res"></A>RESOURCES AND ACTIVITIES</B> 
<P>
<B>Facilities</B> 
<P>
The activities of the college are housed in the Architecture Building,
which was constructed in 1966 and expanded in 1970 and 1978. It
is a three-story facility that houses the majority of the design
studios, classrooms and seminar rooms, a large and completely
equipped audio-visual lecture hall, model shop, faculty offices,
exhibition areas, archives and the college library. The library
has an extensive collection of books and periodicals about architecture
and related environmental design fields. An important and active
part of this resource is the 35mm slide collection covering the
historical and contemporary architecture of the world.
<P>
<B>Accreditation and Affiliations</B> 
<P>
The program is fully accredited by the National Architectural
Accrediting Board. Most states require that an individual intending
to become an architect hold an accredited degree. There are two
types of degrees that are accredited by the National Architectural
Accrediting Board: (1) The Bachelor of Architecture, which requires
a minimum of five years of study, and (2) The Master of Architecture
which requires a minimum of three years of study following an
unrelated bachelor's degree or two years following a related preprofessional
bachelor's degree. These professional degrees are structured to
educate those who aspire to registration/licensure as architects.
<P>
The four-year preprofessional degree, where offered, is not accredited
by the NAAB. The preprofessional degree is useful for those wishing
a foundation in the field of architecture, as preparation for
either continued education in a professional degree program or
for employment options in architecturally related areas. The College
of Architecture is affiliated with the Association of Collegiate
Schools of Architecture and recognizes a chapter of the American
Institute of Architecture Students. There is a regular liaison
with the Southern Arizona Chapter of the American Institute of
Architects and AIA Arizona, both of which lend support to the
college.
<P>
<B>Placement Services</B> 
<P>
Arizona graduates tend to work nationally and internationally.
The College regularly receives requests from firms in all regions
of the country seeking to employ Arizona graduates. These are
referred to fifth-year students who arrange their own interviews.
Some firms come to the college to interview graduating seniors.
Other firms offer third- and fourth-year students summer internships
with the goal of hiring those <BR>
students upon graduation. Many fifth-year students target a specific
city or region of the country and arrange interviews during the
spring break of the fifth year. The University Career and Placement
Service also provides employment assistance for fifth-year and
former students. Positions are normally available for all graduates
willing to relocate.
<P>
<B>Scholarships and Financial Aid</B> 
<P>
All architecture majors are eligible to apply for university scholarships
and aid. In addition, for students in the professional phase of
the program there are special College of Architecture scholarships,
as well as a short-term loan fund. For further information, refer
to the section on <I>Scholarships and Financial Aid.</I> 
<P>
<B>Awards and Honors</B> 
<P>
Outstanding student accomplishments are recognized each year through
the presentation of a number of awards, including the Outstanding
Graduating Senior Award, the National School Medal of the American
Institute of Architects, the Henry Adams Fund Award, the National
School Medal of Alpha Rho Chi and Faculty Commendation Awards.
The Dean's List citation goes to all students who attain a grade
average of 3.500 or better for a semester while carrying no fewer
than 15 units of work.
<P>
<B>Student Guidance</B> 
<P>
Each entering student is assigned a faculty advisor who is available
for guidance and counseling throughout the academic year. The
faculty advisors maintain regular office hours and students are
encouraged to review their progress and problems with their advisors.
