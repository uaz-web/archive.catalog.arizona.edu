<A NAME="expenses"></A>EXPENSES AND FEES GENERAL POLICIES
<P>
All fees are payable prior to the due date for any semester or
term. Students' payments will be applied in chronological order
to charges on their accounts. Payment of fees entitles students
to many services, including instruction in university courses,
use of university libraries, use of laboratory and course equipment,
use of the recreation center, etc. No reduction is made for students
who may choose not to use some of these university services or
facilities.
   The University accepts Visa, MasterCard and checks for the
amount due but cannot advance cash on checks. The University cannot
extend credit or accept installment payments; therefore, all fees
for the semester must be paid in full at the time of registration.
Students with past-due debts to The University of Arizona are
considered financially ineligible to register until outstanding
debts are paid in full. The registration of a student whose check
is returned to the bank is considered incomplete and a late fee
will be assessed. Collection fees are also assessed if payment
for returned checks is not received in 12 calendar days. 

<P>
GENERAL FEES RELATED TO REGISTRATION
<P>
<I>REGISTRATION AND TUITION FEES-<BR>
</I>Registration and specified fees are paid by all students enrolled
at The University of Arizona; in addition, non-resident students
pay tuition in lieu of the state legislative funding provided
to the University through taxes paid by the state's residents.
Conditions determining residency are established by Arizona state
law. For a summary of those conditions and the process for determining
residency status, see the section of this catalog titled Residency
(Domicile) Classification for Tuition Purposes, in the chapter
titled <I>Admission and Registration.</I> For further information,
consult the Office of Domicile Classification.
<P>
<I>THE ARIZONA FINANCIAL AID TRUST (AFAT)-</I>The Arizona Legislature
approved a program of student aid, the Arizona Financial Aid Trust,
which became effective in the 1989-90 academic year. This program
was enacted through the efforts of the student governments on
state campuses, the Arizona Student Association, the Arizona Board
of Regents and the State Legislature. The program enables currently
enrolled students in Arizona universities to receive additional
financial aid and provides for the creation of a long-term endowment
to assist future generations of Arizona students. As a result
of the authorizing legislation and action by the Arizona Board
of Regents, an Arizona Financial Aid Trust fee is assessed to
all students who register for any fall, spring and summer term
and is nonrefundable once class begins.
<P>
<I>RECREATION CENTER FEE-</I>In 1985, students adopted a referendum
assessing themselves a mandatory $25 per semester fee to construct
the Recreation Center. All students registering for four or more
units of credit are charged the recreation center fee.
<P>
<I>LATE PAYMENT AND LATE REGISTRATION FEES-</I>A student who fails
to complete payment of all fees prior to the due date for any
semester or term will be assessed an escalating non-refundable
late payment fee. Students who fail to register prior to the first
day of class will be assessed an additional late registration
fee.<A NAME="tuition"></A>

<I>MEAL PLAN (FOOD SERVICE) --</I> The University of Arizona's
food services are provided by the Student Union. Eating locations
are primarily located in the Student Union Building, Park Student
Center, and satellite facilities located around the campus.
<P>
The University of Arizona's All Aboard program is the Student
Union's computerized meal plan. It offers students the opportunity
to eat at any of the Union's 19 campus restaurants, and over 200
food and beverage vending machines. In addition to the convenience
of not having to carry cash, students who participate in the All
Aboard Meal Plan are not charged tax on their food purchases.
This constitutes a substantial savings on the actual cost of meals.
The average female student spends $700-$900 per semester; the
average male student spends $900-$1200 per semester.
<P>
In addition to the All Aboard Meal Plan students can establish
a Pocket Money account that offers the same cash free convenience.
Students with Pocket Money accounts are able to access the services
of the Fast Copy Center, Gallagher Theatre (movies), Universtiy
Photo Service, Sam's Place (games room), Student Recreation Center
Pro Shop, as well as paying for Residence Hall In-room Phone charges.
<P>
All Aboard and Pocket Money accounts are pre-paid (debit card)
systems. Students access their accounts by presenting their student
identification card. A minimum payment of $25.00 is required to
open an account. Monies deposited in an All Aboard account are
restricted to the purchase of food and beverages.
