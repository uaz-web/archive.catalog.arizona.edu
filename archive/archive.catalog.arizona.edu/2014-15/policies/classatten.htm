  <p>Students are expected to be regular and punctual in class attendance. The
  University believes that students themselves are primarily responsible for
  attendance. Instructors will provide students with written statements of their
  policies with respect to absences. Excessive or extended absence from class is
  sufficient reason for the instructor to recommend that the student be
  administratively dropped from the course. For those courses in which
  enrollment is limited, missing the first class session may be interpreted as
  excessive absence. If this action is filed in the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
 <a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">Office of the Registrar</a> by the
  end of the second week of classes (the tenth day of regularly scheduled 
  classes), it will result in cancellation of
  registration in the course. The date the administrative drop is posted on the 
  class roster in UAccess Instructor Center determines how the drop affects the student's academic record:
  <ul>
    <li>Prior to the end of the 2nd week of classes in Fall/Spring (see <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">Dates 
	&amp; Deadlines</a> for shorter terms), the course will be deleted from the
      student's permanent record.</li>
    <li>An administrative drop in weeks three through ten of Fall/Spring
      (see <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">Dates 
	&amp; Deadlines</a> for shorter terms) will result in the <a href="grade.htm"> grade</a> of
      W, regardless of whether the student is passing at the time.</li>
    <li>The grade of XO is awarded for students who
      are administratively dropped for courses taken for <a href="audit.htm">audit</a>
      after the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
      <a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">deadline</a>
      to drop without a grade of W.</li>
    <li>After the end of the 10th week of classes in Fall/Spring (see <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">Dates 
	&amp; Deadlines</a> for 
	shorter terms), administrative drops will not be processed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The student may notify the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/contactinformation">Dean of
  Students Office</a> when an absence
  from class of one week or more is unavoidable. The office will maintain a file
  of such reports available to instructors upon request.</p>
  <h4>PLEASE NOTE:</h4>
<p>Administrative drop is an instructor's option, not an obligation.
  Instructors are not required to drop students who fail to attend class. Any
  student who intends to drop or withdraw from a course must do so following <a href="dropadd.htm">drop
and withdrawal</a>
  instructions. Students who remain
  enrolled in a course throughout the term but fail to attend class may receive an E grade 
for the
  course.</p>
