The interdisciplinary program in Planning directs a graduate
professional program leading to the Master of Science degree with
a major in planning.

The major consists of 54 units: 36 units of core course work and
18 units in a chosen area of concentration. Core courses include
500, 544, 557, 584, 605, 611, 657, 693, 696, and Law 660. Areas
of concentration include: arid lands (addressing development in
arid environments), community design (focusing on physical
dimensions of urban design), environmental planning (stressing
behavioral aspects of environmental issues), regional planning
(emphasizing mainstream urban and regional land-use development),
renewable natural resources (allowing both resource management
and landscape design options), transportation planning (stressing
travel forecasting and facilities design), and water resources
(allowing both analytical and policy options).

The program requires completion of a projects course.  A
comprehensive written examination or professional report must be
completed as part of the 54 units of course work. Internship
experience is required and students are exposed to field
applications in other course work as well. The program is
specifically designed to expose students to the interdisciplinary
nature of most planning problems. The course work provides a
mixture of theoretical and practical perspectives on diverse
planning issues.

Interested persons should contact the program chairs for further
information.
