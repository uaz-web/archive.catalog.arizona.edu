The study of economics is designed for those who wish to
concentrate in economic analysis to prepare for careers in
business, government, teaching, or private research and
consulting.

A Bachelor of Arts with a major in economics is available through
the College of Arts and Sciences.  The degrees of Bachelor of
Science in Business Administration with a major in business
economics, and Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy with a
major in economics are also offered.  The department participates
in the Master of Business Administration and Master of Public
Administration degrees as well.

The major in economics consists of a minimum of 30 units,
including 200 or 201a-201b or 210; 332; 361, 339 or 376 (or STAT
451), and 15 additional upper-division units of which at least 9
units must be selected from 405, 406, 407, 411, 418, 421, 424,
425, 430, 435, 437, 442, 443, 444, 453, 460, 461, 481, 482, and
489. All majors are required to complete MATH 123 or 124 or 125a
(which are a prerequisite for 332 and 361). Students with a
strong background in mathematics are encouraged to select 210, to
substitute 411 for 361, to substitute MATH 464 and STAT 466 for
339, and to include 418 and 421 in the major. Such students
should take, at a minimum, MATH 125a-125b and 215. It is strongly
recommended that students contemplating graduate study in
economics opt for this sequence and supplement it with additional
mathematics courses.

The major in business economics: See the College of Business and
Public Administration section of this catalog.

The nonbusiness minor consists of a minimum of 20 units in
economics, including 200 or 201a-201b or 210; 300 (or 332); 330
or 361 and other electives needed to meet minor requirements of
the student's college.

The department participates in the honors program. Honors courses
are open to both majors and nonmajors. Students can obtain
information by contacting the honors program and the honors
advisor of the department. Currently, courses designated as
honors courses are 332H, 361H, 406H, 418H, 435H, 442H, 443H,
