The Department of Plant Sciences provides education to prepare a
student for a wide range of opportunities in plant-related
sciences and agriculture. The Bachelor of Science in Agriculture
is available to undergraduate students with a major in plant
sciences.

The department also offers the Master of Science and Doctor of
Philosophy degrees with a major in plant science. For graduate
admission and degree requirements, consult the Graduate Catalog.

Undergraduate students must complete course work in five of the
six study areas, as listed under the general education
requirements in the College of Agriculture section of this
catalog.

Plant sciences majors:  The following courses are required: CHEM
103a-103b, 104a-104b, 241a, 243a and either 241b/243b or BIOC
460; MATH 124; MCB 181; PHYS 180a and either 102a or 103a; PL S
100, 101, 312, 450, 495a, SW 200, 201 and a course in crop/plant
physiology. Each major is required to develop an area of emphasis
within the department by completing an additional minimum of 12
upper-division units chosen from departmental or closely related
courses and selected in consultation with a major advisor. The
areas of interest include ornamental/landscape horticulture, crop
science, turfgrass culture, fruit/vegetable/nut production,
general plant biology.

The agricultural business curriculum: Students selecting this
curriculum may major in plant sciences. Students must complete
the requirements for the major as indicated above with the
exception that one of the following courses is required: PL S
