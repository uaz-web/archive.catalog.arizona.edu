The graduate interdisciplinary program in epidemiology offers the
opportunity for study in the scientific discipline concerned with
the causes and prevention of disease in human populations.
Advances in clinical medicine, laboratory science, environmental
health, nutrition, statistics, computer data processing and the
basic understanding of the pathogenesis of disease enable
epidemiology researchers to better examine causes of disease and
to evaluate more effective strategies for disease prevention and
control. Multidisciplinary collaborations between program faculty
and members of university departments and state and national
health institutions provide classroom and community training
opportunities. To accomplish this goal, faculty program members
with overlapping expertise from several health science
departments have been selected to direct courses and research.

Degrees

The Graduate Program in Epidemiology offers a major in
epidemiology for the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy
degrees.
