Chemical engineering is concerned with utilization and
application of scientific theory and principles to develop safe,
environmentally and economically sound manufacturing processes in
which chemical and/or physical changes take place. The curriculum
prepares the student for employment in the research, development,
design and operations aspects of the chemical, petroleum, micro-
electronics, metals, plastics, food, pharmaceutical, energy and
related industries.

The department offers the following degrees: Bachelor of Science
in Chemical Engineering, Master of Science and Doctor of
Philosophy with a major in chemical engineering. For graduate
admission and degree requirements, consult the Graduate Catalog.

The major requires 137 units of science, engineering and
