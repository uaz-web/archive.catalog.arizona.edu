The Department of Astronomy offers several introductory general
education courses, as well as Bachelor of Science, Master of
Science, and Doctor of Philosophy degree programs. For graduate
admission and degree requirements, consult the Graduate Catalog.

Major: The B.S. in Astronomy major is designed to prepare
students for graduate work or professional employment in
astronomy, astrophysics, and related fields. The curriculum
combines courses and research in astronomy and astrophysics with
a strong foundation of courses in physics and mathematics. The
major requires 33 units. Required courses are ASTR 300a-300b,
302, 400a-400b, and 499 (senior research project); PHYS 410,
415a, 425, and 435; and a 3-unit course in mathematics,
statistics, or computational techniques, selected from a list
approved by the department. (Students pursuing a double major
with physics may substitute other upper-division courses in
astronomy, mathematics, physics, or planetary science for the
physics courses listed above.) Prerequisites to the required
courses include MATH 125a-125b, 223, 254; and PHYS 111a-111b,
112a-112b (or 110, 116, 121, 330). As explained below, these
prerequisite courses may be used to fulfill the minor
requirement. A theoretical astrophysics concentration is also
available to majors in this department. This concentration is an
informal program of mentoring and research opportunities for
students with high academic standing. Interested students should
contact their department advisor for information about this
program.

Prospective students should be aware that the curriculum for this
major is very demanding, and requires solid preparation in high
school mathematics and science. A student who lacks such
preparation should expect to take longer than four years to
complete the degree requirements.

Minors: For department majors, an optional structured minor
consisting of MATH 125a-125b, 223, and 254; and PHYS 111a-111b
(or 110, 116) is available. Other minor options are available to
students in other departments. These include a 20-unit technical
minor, mainly for science and engineering majors, and a 20-unit
liberal arts minor for students in other fields. Consult the
College of Arts and Sciences or the astronomy department office
for details.

Teaching Majors: The department does not offer a teaching major
in astronomy. However, students interested in secondary school
science teaching may earn teaching majors in Physics or Earth
Science (which includes astronomy). Information on these majors
is given under the catalog listings for the Department of Physics
and the Department of Geosciences, respectively.

The department participates in the Honors Program.
