Pharmacology is a broad discipline involving the investigation of
the actions of drugs and chemicals upon living material at all
levels of organization. The discipline occupies an important
interface between the basic medical sciences and the clinical
sciences, drawing strongly upon the former for its contribution
to the latter. Research in pharmacology utilizes all appropriate
techniques of modern biology from the molecular to the clinical
levels. In the health professions, pharmacologic knowledge is
applied to the diagnosis, prevention, cure or relief of symptoms
of disease, and in the promotion of optimal health. The basic
pharmacologic principles are emphasized in both medical and
graduate student teaching. This will permit the student to
develop techniques of problem solving to keep abreast of advances
in pharmacology through his/her professional career.

In conjunction with other departments in the University, the
department participates in an interdisciplinary graduate program
leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree in pharmacology and
toxicology. The department also offers a program of instruction
leading to the Master of Science degree with a major in
pharmacology. See the Graduate Interdisciplinary Program in
Pharmacology and Toxicology.
