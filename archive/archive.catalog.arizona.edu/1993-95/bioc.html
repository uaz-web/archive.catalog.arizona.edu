Biochemistry provides the fundamentals for study of the molecular
principles in biology, medicine, and the health sciences and
agricultural sciences. Teaching and research in biochemistry are
carried out in several locations in the University. The faculty
members listed above constitute the University Department of
Biochemistry, which is responsible for instruction in
biochemistry in the Colleges of Agriculture, Arts and Science,
and Medicine. These programs serve as an excellent background for
graduate study in biochemistry or the many health-related
sciences, including a major preprofessional program for
qualification for professional schools of medicine, dentistry and
osteopathy.

The University Department of Biochemistry offers the Bachelor of
Science, Bachelor of Science in Agriculture, Bachelor of Arts,
Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees with a major
in biochemistry. Applicants are not admitted directly to the
Master of Science program. The degree is awarded only in rare
instances when individuals admitted to Ph.D. programs terminate
early.

The major for the B.S.: CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b, or 105a-105b,
241a-241b, 243a-243b, 480a and 480b or 481, MATH 125a-125b, 223;
PHYS 104a-104b; BIOC 181R, 182, 411, 462a-462b, 494, 496a (2
units), and 6 upper-division units in biology, chemistry,
mathematics, or physics, exclusive of individual studies. All
students will participate in a senior research practicum (494)
for a minimum of six units after taking 462a-462b and 411. Senior
research is conducted in the laboratory of a faculty member with
approval of the advisor, and must include the writing of a senior
thesis.

The major for the B.A.: CHEM 103a-103b, 104a-104b, or 105a-105b,
241a-241b, 243a-243b, 480a; MATH 125a; PHYS 102a-102b; BIOC 181R,
182; 462a-462b, 411, 496a (2 units), 499 (one unit), and 6 upper-
division units in biology, chemistry, mathematics, or physics,
exclusive of individual studies. All B.A. students will sign up
for BIOC 499 for a minimum of one hour. The credit will be given
for the writing of a senior research paper under the direction of
a faculty advisor. Those who apply for medical school should take
ECOL 320 in preparation for the Medical College Admission Test
(MCAT).

The minor for both undergraduate degrees consists of CHEM 103a-
103b, 104a-104b, 241a-241b, 243a-243b, MATH 124 or 125a plus the
following course sequences in Biochemistry: 1) BIOC 462a (3),
BIOC 462b (3), and BIOC 411 (3); or, 2) BIOC 460 (5) plus one
other course approved by a faculty member.
