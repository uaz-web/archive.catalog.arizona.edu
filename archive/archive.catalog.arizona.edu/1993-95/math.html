Mathematics forms a foundation for all technical disciplines and
is an excellent preparation for a career or graduate study in
many subjects. The department offers courses in pure mathematics,
applied mathematics, probability and statistics, computational
mathematics, engineering mathematics and mathematics education.
Planned minors in numerous professional fields are available;
interested persons should consult with a Mathematics Department
advisor to help choose the option, minor, and additional course
work that best prepares for their chosen career.

Mathematics is available as a major for the following degrees:
Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science (College of Arts and
Sciences), Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mathematics
(College of Engineering and Mines), Bachelor of Arts in Education
(Elementary Education--College of Education) and Bachelor of
