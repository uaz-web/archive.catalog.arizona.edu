Russian and Soviet studies is an interdisciplinary committee that
offers courses in the many disciplines involved in the study of
Russia and the former Soviet Union. It is designed to prepare
students for careers in government, academia, and business. The
committee offers the Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in
Russian and Soviet studies.

The major consists of 30 units of course work: RUSS 120 and 301a-
301b, 250a or 250b or 310; RSS 409, 422, 425, 443, 496a, 496b.
RSS 496a must be taken in the spring semester of the junior year;
496b in the fall semester of the senior year. Appropriate
independent study credits may be substituted.

Although not required for the major, a number of classes in area
studies, the humanities and the social sciences are recommended
as introductory courses for Russian and Soviet studies majors.

The minor in Russian and Soviet studies consists of 21 units of
course work chosen from one of the following departments:
Geography and Regional Development, History, Management
Information Systems, East Asian Studies and/or Near Eastern
Studies, and Political Science. A list of courses considered
suitable for the minor is available from Russian and Soviet
Studies advisors.

In addition to the courses listed above, the committee offers
