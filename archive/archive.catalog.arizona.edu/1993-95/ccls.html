Comparative Cultural and Literary Studies explore similarities
and differences within and among national cultures and
literatures, as well as in the work of individuals, using a
variety of methods from the humanities and social sciences. Such
interdisciplinary studies focus on the production, circulation,
and interpretation of meaning and value in all cultural activity.

The Program offers the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees with a major in
comparative cultural and literary studies. Students pursue a core
of theoretical courses and study at least two primary discourses.
Courses are taught by faculty from a variety of cooperating
departments and programs. A list of affiliated faculty is
available from the program office. The master's degree is
considered primarily as leading to the Ph.D. degree.
