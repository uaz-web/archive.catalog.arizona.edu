Animal sciences is a field of study involving the production,
marketing, and utilization of animals in agriculture,
entertainment, and companionship. Students gain knowledge in the
biological processes involved in genetics, nutrition, and
reproduction as well as in the practical business aspects of
racing and livestock management. Students may find employment in
production management, racing administration, or within other
related industries serving the agricultural sector such as
agribusiness firms, financial institutions, and breed
associations. Students may also complete a field of study that
prepares them for admission to graduate programs in agriculture
or the biological and life sciences or professional schools in
veterinary medicine or medicine. A minor in animal sciences is
available for nonmajors. The department also offers programs
leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy
degrees. For information regarding graduate degrees, see the
Graduate Catalog.
