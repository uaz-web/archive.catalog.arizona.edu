  <p>A, B, C, D, and E constitute the regular grades used at the University of
  Arizona. All individual studies courses and some
  small group courses use special grades:&nbsp; S (superior) and P (pass).&nbsp; See <a href="crsnum.htm">Grades Available for
  House-Numbered Courses</a> (independent study, colloquium, internships, etc)

<p>S (superior) and P (pass)
grades are used in place of regular grades A and B,
respectively, for courses graded S, P, C, D, E and S, P, E, K.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S and
P grades are NOT included
in the calculation of the GPA, nor do they count toward meeting the criteria for

<p><b>S, P, F grading:</b>&nbsp; For the majority of individual studies courses,

<p><b>* NOTE:</b> For house numbered courses with a choice of grading systems (senior 
capstone, colloquium, etc.), an instructor may have the option of awarding 
regular grades only (A,B,C,D,E) or the combination of special and regular grades 
(S,P,C,D,E), as departmental policy dictates.&nbsp; However, in any single class 
offering, all registrants must be graded by the same system.</p>

  <p><b><a name="passfail">Pass/Fail Option</a></b></p>
  <p>For certain courses, a qualified student may elect to register under the
  pass/fail option. Under such registration, the only final grades available to
  the student are P (pass) or F (fail).</p>
  <p>Undergraduate students may elect to take courses under the pass/fail option
  only after they have attained sophomore standing and only if they have earned
  grade-point-averages of 2.000 or better.</p>
  <p>Students registering for a course under the pass/fail option must meet the
  prerequisites or otherwise satisfy the instructor of their ability to take the
  course.</p>
  <p>Undergraduate students may register under the pass/fail option for not more
  than two courses per semester up to a maximum of 12 courses. Further, they
  must carry a minimum of 12 units of regular grades other than P/F during each
  semester in which they elect courses under the pass/fail option. Any
  exceptions to this policy must be approved by the student's academic dean.</p>
  <p><b>Courses taken under the pass/fail option must be electives only, and may
  not be used to fulfill major, minor, or other specified curriculum
  requirements.</b></p>
  <p>The pass/fail option is not generally available to graduate students. The
  only exceptions to this proscription are: (a) admission deficiencies which the
  student has prior specific, written approval to take on a P/F basis (only the
  department head or the departmental graduate adviser may give such approval,
  which must be on file in the Graduate College office before registration); (b)
  any undergraduate non-deficiency course available for P/F grading; and (c) any
  course offered by the College of Law.</p>
  <p>Each department decides which of its courses will be available under the
  pass/fail option. Pass/fail courses in the 500, 600, or 700 series may be
  offered only in law. Further, the instructor of the course must approve of its
  being offered pass/fail. The instructor shall be informed by the Office of
  Curriculum and Registration
  which students are enrolled under the pass/fail option.</p>
  <p>Students may change from pass/fail enrollment to enrollment for a regular
  grade, or vice versa, only during the time period prior to the last day of the
  fourth calendar week during which classes are held, except with special
  permission of the student's college dean.</p>
  <p>If a course is taken under the pass/fail option, the grade of P or F will
  be permanently recorded. However, neither grade will be included in the
  average. If the course is passed, the units of credit will be applied toward
  graduation.</p>
  <p><b>College of Medicine</b> --
  All courses in the College of Medicine are graded on a superior/pass (S/P)
  system for medical students.</p>
  <p><b>Teaching and Teacher Education</b>
  -- Pass/fail grades are the only grades available for 493A and 493B.
  Enrollment in these courses will not reduce the amount for which a student can
  otherwise enroll under the pass/fail option.</p>

of Incomplete Grade</a> form as a contract with the student as to what course

<p><span style="color:black">If the incomplete grade is not removed by the 
instructor within one year (the last day of finals one year later), the <b>I</b> 
grade will convert to a failing grade. For undergraduate courses, the one-year 
limit may be extended for one additional year if, prior to converting to an E, 
the extension is approved by the instructor and the dean of the college in which 
the student is registered. This extension requires the instructor and dean's 
signature on a Petition for Extension of Course Work.&nbsp; Notification of the 
dean's approval or denial is to be provided to the student by the dean's 
office.&nbsp; A copy of the approved or denied Petition must then be forwarded from 
the dean's office to the Office of the Registrar, Administration 210, for 
appropriate processing.&nbsp; Once the <b>I</b><i> </i>has converted to an <b>E</b>, 
a one-year extension will only be considered if the student submits an appeal to 
the University General Petition Committee.&nbsp; Additionally, a request for an 
extension of time beyond 2 academic years of the original course enrollment 
requires approval by the General Petition Committee.&nbsp; For courses taken for 
graduate credit, such approval may be granted only by the Graduate College.</span></p>
  <p><b>K&nbsp; <a name="K">Course in Progress</a></b></p>
  <p>The grade of K may be awarded by the instructor for 900-level courses when
  the course continues for longer than one semester. Students must re-enroll for
  these courses each semester. K grades remain on the student's permanent record
  until removed with a final grade but do not enter into the calculation of the
  grade-point-average. Time-limit for completion of such work for full credit
  for the master's degree is six years; for the doctoral degree, ten years.</p>
  <p>The grade of K is assigned for all supplementary registration (930) at the
  time of enrollment and will remain permanently on the student's academic
  record.</p>
  <p>For any course, other than the 900 series, that requires more than one
  semester for completion, the grade of K is awarded by the Office of Curriculum and
  Registration at the end of the semester and carried to the next semester.</p>
  <p><b>W&nbsp; <a name="W">Withdrawal Grade</a>:&nbsp; Dropping a Course</b></p>
  <p>Prior to the end of the fourth week of classes, official withdrawal (drop)
  of a course cancels the registration for the course. A dean’s approval is
  not required. No grade for the course will appear on the student’s permanent
  record. During weeks five through eight, the grade of W is awarded to students
  who are passing at the time of withdrawal. The grade of E may be awarded to
  students not passing at the time of withdrawal. Either W or E will show on the
  student’s permanent record.</p>
  <p>After the eighth week of classes, the grade of W can be awarded only with
  the approval of the student’s academic dean, and only under exceptional
  circumstances. The W may also be awarded in the case of complete withdrawal
  from the University.</p>

  withdraws before the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> week of classes in Fall/Spring
  (end of the 1<sup>st</sup> week in a Summer term), no classes show on the

  University between the 5<sup>th</sup> week of classes in Fall/Spring (2<sup>nd</sup>
  week in a Summer term) and the last day of classes for the semester/term, the
  faculty member for each course may assign a grade of W/P (withdrawal while
  passing), or W/F (withdrawal while failing). Neither grade is used to
  calculate the GPA. The refund schedule is listed for each semester/term in the

  <p><b>O&nbsp; <a name="0">Audit Grade</a></b></p>
  <p>The grade of O, with no grade-point value, is awarded for courses taken for

  (Policy updated May 13, 2004: Change 'Y' to Blank indicator for no grade 
  submitted.)</font></p>
  <p>Effective Spring 2003, no grade 
  indicator is entered when an instructor fails to submit grades for all 
  students in a course by the grade reporting deadline at the end of the term.&nbsp; 
  Prior to Spring 2003, students were 
  awarded a temporary grade of 'Y' after the grade reporting deadline and prior 
  to receiving the final grade from the instructor.</p>
<p>Consistent with current practice, if grades are issued for some but not all 
students in a class, those students who were not awarded a grade by the 
instructor will be awarded an administrative grade of 'E' by the Office of 
Curriculum &amp; Registration.</p>
