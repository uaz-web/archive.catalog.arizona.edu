<p align="left">The majority of courses at the University are graded with regular grades.&nbsp;
Exceptions include:&nbsp; most <a href="house.htm">house-numbered

Courses using alternative grades are designated as such in the <a href="../courses/aaindex.html">course

<p>S (superior) and P (pass)
grades are used in place of regular grades A and B,

<p><b>S, P, C, D, E grading:</b>&nbsp; for several <a href="house.htm">house numbered courses</a> (proseminar, colloquium, etc), one of the grading systems available is the combination of special and

<p><b>S, P, E, K grading:</b>&nbsp; some 900-level <a href="house.htm">house numbered courses</a>

      the failing grade of E.&nbsp; See K Course in Progress below.</p>
<p><b>S, P, F grading:</b>&nbsp; For the majority of individual studies courses,

<p><b>* NOTE:</b> For house numbered courses with a choice of grading systems (senior 
capstone, colloquium, etc.), an instructor may have the option of awarding 
regular grades only (A,B,C,D,E) or the combination of special and regular grades 
(S,P,C,D,E), as departmental policy dictates.&nbsp; However, in any single class 
offering, all registrants must be graded by the same system.</p>

<p><b><br>
  K&nbsp;Grade, <a name="K">Course in Progress</a>:</b></p>
<p>K for non-900-level courses:&nbsp; if a course requires more than one term for completion, the grade of K is awarded
for each term except the final term.&nbsp; The final term is awarded a non-K
grade appropriate to the grading scheme for the course (see regular and
alternative grading above).&nbsp; For example, a course that continues for
3 terms would receive the permanent grade of K for the first 2 terms, while the final
term would receive a non-K grade appropriate to the grading scheme for the
course.&nbsp; Course re-registration is not required.</p>
<p>K grade for 900 through 925 <a href="house.htm#900">house
numbered courses</a> and graduate level English writing project courses (e.g. ENGL
501, 604, &amp; 609):&nbsp; the grade of K is awarded by the instructor for
each term when
  the course continues for longer than one term.&nbsp; Once the course is
completed the K grades are replaced with permanent non-K grades appropriate to the grading scheme for the
course.&nbsp; For example, a course that continues for 3 terms would receive
temporary K grades for the first 2 terms.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the course is completed
successfully in the 3rd term all 3 terms then receive the same permanent non-K
grade appropriate to the grading scheme for the course.&nbsp; Students must
register for
  these courses each term, as needed.&nbsp; Time-limit for completion of such work for full credit
  for the master's degree is 6 years; for the doctoral degree, 10 years.</p>

<p>K grade for <a name="930"> 930</a> <a href="house.htm#900">house
numbered courses</a>:&nbsp; the grade of K is awarded
for each term except the final term.&nbsp; The final term is awarded a <a href="grade.htm#credit"> grade of
CR (credit)</a>   upon completion of degree requirements.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; for a student enrolled in a 930 course for 6 terms, the first 5 terms would receive
permanent grades of K, and the final term would receive a permanent grade of
CR.&nbsp; Students must register for 930 courses each term, as needed.</p>

<a href="../../2010-11/policies/grade.htm">2010-11 Catalog</a>. </p>
		<p>For certain courses, a qualified student may elect to register under the
  pass/fail option. Under such registration, the only final grades available to
  the student are P (pass) or F (fail).&nbsp; To receive
the grade of P, the student must be doing work comparable to a D or better.&nbsp;
If a course is taken under the pass/fail option, the grade of P or F will
  be permanently recorded.&nbsp; If the course is passed, the units of credit will be applied toward
  graduation.&nbsp; Pass/fail grades are NOT included in the GPA.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students may elect to take courses under the pass/fail option
  only after they have attained sophomore standing and only if they have earned
  grade-point-averages (GPAs) of 2.000 or better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Courses taken under the pass/fail option must be electives only, and may
  not be used to fulfill general education, major, minor, or other specified curriculum
  requirements.</p>
  <p>Students registering for a course under the pass/fail option must meet the
  prerequisites or otherwise satisfy the instructor of their ability to take the
  course.</p>
  <p>Undergraduate students may register under the pass/fail option for not more
  than 2 courses per semester up to a maximum of 12 courses.&nbsp; Further, they
  must carry a minimum of 12 course units graded with regular grades during each
  term in which they take courses under the pass/fail option.&nbsp; Any
  exceptions to this policy must be approved by the student's academic dean.</p>
  <p>Students may change from pass/fail enrollment to enrollment for a regular
  grade, or vice versa, only during the time period prior to the last day of the
  fourth calendar week (Fall and Spring) during which classes are held, except with special
  permission of the student's college dean.</p>
<p>Each department decides which of its courses will be available under the
  pass/fail option.&nbsp; Further, the instructor of the course must approve of its
  being offered pass/fail. The instructor shall be informed by the Office of the 
Registrar
  which students are enrolled under the pass/fail option.</p>
<p>Courses that are available for pass/fail are designated as such in the Schedule
of Classes as &quot;<b>Available:</b> Pass/Fail.&quot;</p>
  <p>Student Teaching:&nbsp; pass/fail grades are the only grades available for
  FSHD 489, TTE 493A, and TTE 493B.

<p><span style="color:black">The grade of <b>I</b> may be awarded only at the

case, a grade other than <b>I </b>must be assigned.&nbsp; Students should make 
arrangements with the instructor to receive an incomplete grade before the end 
of the term.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Instructors are encouraged to use the 
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">Report 
of Incomplete Grade</a> form as a contract with the student as to what course 
work must be completed by the student for the <b>I</b> grade to be removed and 
replaced with a grade. On the form, the instructor states:&nbsp; (1) which 
assignments or exams should be completed and when; (2) how this work will be 
graded; and (3) how the student's course grade will be calculated. Both the 
instructor and student sign this agreement and both should retain copies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">After the course work is completed, the instructor 
should assign the appropriate grade on a Change of Grade form and submit it to 
the Office of the Registrar for processing. After processing, the new grade will

<p><span style="color:black">If the incomplete grade is not removed by the

the extension is approved by the instructor and the dean of the college in which 
the student is registered. This extension requires the instructor and dean's 
signature on a Petition for Extension of Course Work.&nbsp; Notification of the 
dean's approval or denial is to be provided to the student by the dean's 
office.&nbsp; A copy of the approved or denied Petition must then be forwarded from 
the dean's office to the Office of the Registrar, Administration 210, for 
appropriate processing.&nbsp; Once the <b>I</b><i> </i>has converted to an <b>E</b>, 
a one-year extension will only be considered if the student submits an appeal to 
the University General Petition Committee.&nbsp; Additionally, a request for an 
extension of time beyond 2 academic years of the original course enrollment 
requires approval by the General Petition Committee.&nbsp; For courses taken for 
graduate credit, such approval may be granted only by the Graduate College.</span></p>
<p><b>W&nbsp; <a name="W">Withdrawal</a>, Dropping a Course:</b></p>
  <p>Prior to the end of the fourth week of classes (Fall and Spring), official withdrawal (drop)
  of a course cancels the registration for the course. A dean’s approval is
  not required. No grade for the course will appear on the student’s permanent
  record.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> During weeks five through eight, the grade of W is awarded to students
  who are passing at the time of withdrawal. The grade of E may be awarded to
  students not passing at the time of withdrawal. Either W or E will show on the
  student’s permanent record.</p>
  <p>After the eighth week of classes, the grade of W can be awarded only with
  the approval of the student’s academic dean, and only under exceptional
  circumstances. The W may also be awarded in the case of complete withdrawal
  from the University.</p>
