irradiance, sunspot number, and diameter, and its effect on 
Earth's climate will be addressed in some detail.  Other topics include the physics of the solar interior, solar oscillations, and solar composition.  This course will also introduce the equations of magnetohydrodynamics and apply them to important solar-physics problems, such as: the solar magnetic dynamo, stability of prominences, physics of sunspots and flares, and heating of the solar atmosphere. The emphasis throughout will be on basic physical processes and the various approximations used in their application to concrete problems.
