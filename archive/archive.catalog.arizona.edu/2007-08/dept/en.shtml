  <p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
  <p>An engineering education is preparation for a professional career. While
  most graduates embark on careers in engineering practice, women and men with
  engineering majors find the baccalaureate program excellent preparation for
  other fields as diverse as law, medicine, business, and government.
  Engineering education develops analytical and quantitative thinking, a
  critical but optimistic approach to problem solving, and the habit of
  self-directed future learning. The graduate has a thorough understanding of
  how materials, energy, and information can be adapted to human needs. This
  understanding is developed through the study of physical science, mathematics,
  engineering science, engineering design, humanities, social science and
  practice.</p>
  <p><a name="Admissions"><b>Entrance Requirements</b></a><b>:</b></p>
  <p>In addition to University admission requirements, applicants
  are reviewed as follows:</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Freshmen:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style1">Freshmen applicants with a 1250 SAT Reasoning Test score 
	(combined critical reading and math), 26 ACT score (composite), 3.6 GPA or 
	top 15% class rank and no course work deficiencies will be admitted to their 
	chosen engineering major. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style1">Freshman applicants admitted to UA with a top 25% class 
	rank and one of the following: 1050 SAT (CR+M), 23 ACT composite, 3.0 GPA 
	will be admitted to pre-engineering. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style1">All other applicants will be comprehensively reviewed for 
	admission.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="style1"><strong>Transfer:</strong></p>
<p class="style1">Transfer applicants must have a recalculated GPA of 2.3 plus 
transferable Calculus I credit. To be admissted directly into an engineering 
major, applicants must have completed the core engineering courses with the GPA 
for advanced standing within their intended major. Otherwise, applicants will be 
considered for pre-engineering.<strong> </strong></p>
  <p><a name="Advanced Standing"><b>Advanced Standing</b></a><b>:</b></p>
<p>Students must have been granted advanced standing to enroll
  in 300- or 400-level courses in the College of Engineering. The <img border="0" height="15" src="../images/globe-external.gif" width="15" alt="External Link">
 <a href="http://www.engr.arizona.edu/2_AC/polici.htm#advancedstanding">criteria for achieving advanced standing</a> are available on the
college's homepage, in Room 200 of the Engineering Building, and in departmental offices.</p>
  <p><a name="General_Education_Program"><b>General Education Program</b></a><b>:</b></p>
  <p>All undergraduate students are required to complete a
  general education program. Designed to provide a foundation for university
  learning, the program develops students’ creative and analytical skills and
  integrates knowledge across university disciplines. General education
  requirements are listed in the <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">major
  requirements (APRRs)</a> associated with each degree program, in
  Engineering 200, in departmental offices, or on the college homepage.</p>
  <p>Because of the prerequisite content of engineering
  curricula, for advising purposes degree requirements are presented in a
  semester-by-semester program that can be completed in 4 years. Four-year plans
  for the undergraduate degrees are available in Engineering 200, in
  departmental offices, or on the college homepage.</p>
  <p><b>Academic Advising:</b></p>
  <p>Visit your advisor every semester.&nbsp; Academic advisors are assigned by
  contacting the departmental offices.</p>
  <p><b>Freshman Honors Program:</b></p>
  <p>The College of Engineering Freshman Honors Program recognizes
  the abilities and achievements of high school graduates and offers a variety
  of special challenges and resources to encourage the full development of
  academic and interpersonal skills.&nbsp; Freshman honors students are strongly
  encouraged to register for ENGR 196A and 196B.</p>
  <p><b>Accreditation and the Curricular Content Required for Engineering
  Degrees:</b></p>
  <p>The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is the
  official agency for accrediting undergraduate engineering degrees. For more
  information about ABET requirements, contact the college's Office of Academic
  Affairs at 621-6032.</p>
  <p><b>Scholarships:</b></p>
  <p>A limited number of scholarships are recommended each year by departments
  within the College of Engineering. Students interested in applying
  for these scholarships should contact their departmental offices for
  information. It is usually best to do this prior to March 1.</p>
  <p><b>Student Professional and Honorary Societies:</b></p>
  <p>Contact department or view the college homepage.</p>
  <p><b>Multicultural Engineering Program:</b></p>
<p>The Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP) is an academically-based
  student support program for ethnic minorities and women. For additional
  information, please contact Ray Umashankar, MEP Director, (520) 621-8103,
  Engineering Building, Room 200 or see the college homepage.</p>
  <p><b>Graduate Study:</b></p>
  <p>For information about graduate programs consult the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://grad.arizona.edu/Catalog">Graduate Catalog</a><em>
  </em>or the college office.</p>
  <p><b>Career Preparation:</b></p>
  <p>It is recommended that all engineering students participate in a career
  experience prior to graduation. This experience can be gained by a full-time
  cooperative education work experience, a part-time internship in a local
  company, part-time or summer career employment, or a research experience in a
  faculty member's laboratory. Information is available through the Academic
  Affairs Office in Room 200, Engineering Building.</p>
