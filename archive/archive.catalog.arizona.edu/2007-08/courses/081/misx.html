 -- Problem Definition and Project Plan
 </b>&nbsp;(1 unit)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; Defining a problem for an MS Project requires an understanding of the context within which the problem is articulated, stake holders involved in and impacted by the problem scope and its potential resolution, and getting their buy-in to put the resources needed to solve the problem. This course investigates the technologies used to document and scope the problem, identify the financial, people and time resources needed to solve the problem, and develop a project plan using Microsoft Project. Specific attention will be paid to understanding potential pitfalls or risks that will delay the project and contingency plans to address these risks. 

The course will involve lectures facilitated by the instructor and corporate representatives.  Also incorporated will be case discussions<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall, Spring, Summer.<!--MIS 682 ends-->

 -- Project Execution and Presentation
 </b>&nbsp;(2 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; Successful execution of a project not only starts with a clear articulation of the problem and the development of a project plan, but a careful execution of each step, monitoring the status for potential deviations and putting resources needed to bring the project on track, if there are delays. In addition, the project execution, depending on the nature of the project may require extensive research, prototype system development, and/or in-depth case analysis. The course uses class lectures to reinforces various methods in conducting research, prototype application development and case analysis, and ensures that the students stay focused on the project execution through status reports, intermediate and final presentations (both oral and written) and engage in knowledge sharing for lessons learned.
