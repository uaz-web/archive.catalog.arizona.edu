 -- Latina/o Pop: Race, Gender, Sexuality & Popular Culture
 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This course examines how Latinas/os have been a major force in the production of  popular culture. In particular we will critically examine discourses of “Latinidad” (a seamless construction of Latinos as a monolithic group) in the corporate production of identities.  This lack of attention to national origin and historical specificity is one definition of Latinidad.  Latinidad also provides the contradictory grounds where consumer culture meets Latina/o performance. Some artists choose to reappropriate commercial spaces as sites of empowerment, while others are complicit in perpetuating stereotypical representations of Latinas/os.  With special attentiveness to the body,  we will explore the construction of Latina/o identities as they influence and produce particular racial, sexual and gendered identities. The body becomes an essential marker of “Latinidad,”  which is constantly connected to notions of sexuality. We will also examine the material effects of such cultural and commercial practices upon U.S. Latino populations, reminding us that there are real-world implications for these performances as they commodify Latina/o culture.  To account for the shifts in notions of performance and cultural practices, the focus of the course will center Latina/o/Chicana/o musical production, movies, television, advertising, magazines, literary texts, performance art, murals, installation art, music videos, and animation within a historical context.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Prerequisite(s):</b>&nbsp; Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors only.<br><b>Identical to:</b>&nbsp;   ENGL 312,  MAS 312.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall, Spring.<!--W S 312 ends-->

 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This course is an intensive investigation of the life of the ancient Israelite woman.  It presents a multidisciplinary approach toward reconstructing the social, economic, religious and political life of women in Iron Age Israel.  Through readings and class discussion, students will explore the ways in which women contributed to their society throughout the eras of the Judges and of the United and Divided Monarchies (1200-587 BCE).
Because women traditionally have been undervalued and marginalized, until recently little attention was devoted to this vitally important and stimulating topic.  In consequence, students will be challenged to utilize mulitple sources in their reconstruction of the lives of Israelite women.  The sources used in this class will include (but not be limited to) archaelogical, historical and art historical data, the witness of the Hebrew Bible and other pertinent texts, and anthropological and ethnographic studies of the roles of women in preindustrial and Middle eastern societies.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Identical to:</b>&nbsp;  JUS 447; JUS  is home department.<br><b>May be convened with:</b>&nbsp; W S 547.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall, Spring.<!--W S 447 ends-->

 -- Women in Ancient Israel
 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This course is an intensive investigation of the life of the ancient Israelite woman.  It presents a multidisciplinary approach toward reconstructing the social, economic, religious and political life of women in Iron Age Israel.  Through readings and class discussion, students will explore the ways in which women contributed to their society throughout the eras of the Judges and of the United and Divided Monarchies (1200-587 BCE).
Because women traditionally have been undervalued and marginalized, until recently little attention was devoted to this vitally important and stimulating topic.  In consequence, students will be challenged to utilize mulitple sources in their reconstruction of the lives of Israelite women.  The sources used in this class will include (but not be limited to) archaelogical, historical and art historical data, the witness of the Hebrew Bible and other pertinent texts, and anthropological and ethnographic studies of the roles of women in preindustrial and Middle eastern societies. Graduate-level requirements include meeting as a group, in advance (date to be determined) to organize the presentation of their papers.  Each student will be assigned a "reviewer".<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Identical to:</b>&nbsp;  JUS 547; JUS  is home department.<br><b>May be convened with:</b>&nbsp; W S 447.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall, Spring.<!--W S 547 ends-->
