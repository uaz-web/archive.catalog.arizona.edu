<h2 align="center">Graduation Averages and Credit Requirements </h2>

<h3>Graduation Average </h3>
<p><font color="#FF0000">(Policy update 1/29/08, clarifying grades to be 
included)</font></p>

<p>A graduation average of 2.000 for all University Credit course work 
undertaken and for any work satisfied by the Special Examination for Grade is 
required for the bachelor's degree. Note: The graduation grade average is based 
only on University Credit grades awarded prior to the graduation date, when all 
degree requirements have been satisfied.</p>

<h3>Major Average </h3>

<p>Majors for undergraduate degrees require an average of 2.000 or better for <i>all </i>University
Credit work undertaken in the major field or for any work satisfied by the Special
Examination for Grade if in the major. </p>

<h3>Averaging Of Grade For Final Non-University Credit Course </h3>

<p>Students who lack not more than a one-semester course toward the fulfillment of
curriculum and minimum-graduation-average requirements, may apply as the final course to
complete the degree, a single one-semester course either in residence at another
accredited institution or in correspondence work through The University of Arizona.
Permission must be obtained from the academic dean, prior to enrolling for the course, to
apply the grade received in such a course toward the graduation average. This provision
may be applied also to the required separate average of 2.0000 in the major field if prior
permission is obtained from the major professor and the academic dean. </p>

<h3>University Credit Requirement </h3>

<p>A minimum of 30 units of University Credit from The University of Arizona is required
for the bachelor's degree. It is further required that 18 of the final 30 units offered
toward the degree be University Credit. Various departments have specific University
Credit requirements for their majors, and students should consult individual departmental
information sections for this information. For a definition of University Credit, see <a href="enrpol.htm"><em>Credit Definitions and Enrollment Policies.</em></a></p>

<h3>Upper-Division Unit Requirement </h3>

<p>The University of Arizona recognizes both breadth and depth of knowledge as important
characteristics of a baccalaureate degree. To insure depth of study beyond introductory
levels, the University has a general policy requiring students to complete a minimum of 42
units of upper-division course work for graduation. This requirement applies to students
graduating under the 1991-93 catalog or any subsequent catalog. The special requirements
of some academic programs may necessitate an exception to this requirement. Some degree
programs require fewer than 42 units of upper-division credit. For current information,
students should consult their advisors, the department which offers their major, or the <i>On
Course</i>! <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics"><font size="3">Academic
Program Requirements Report</font></a> for their major to determine if their degree
program may require fewer than 42 units of upper-division credit. </p>

<h3>Correspondence And Credit By Examination Credit Maximums </h3>

<p>A maximum of 60 units toward a bachelor's degree may be earned through correspondence
credit and/or credit by examination. </p>
