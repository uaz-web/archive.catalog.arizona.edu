<h2 align="left">Continuous Enrollment</h2>

<p>Students may maintain continuous enrollment whether attending a single public community
college or university in Arizona or transferring among public institutions in Arizona
while pursuing their degrees. Continuous enrollment status of a student and the catalog of
determination for a student are defined by: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. A semester in which a student earns course credit will be counted toward continuous
  enrollment. Noncredit courses, audited courses, failed courses, or courses from which the
  student withdraws do not count toward the determination of continuous enrollment for
  catalog purposes. </p>
  <p>2. Students who do not meet the minimum enrollment standard stipulated in No. 1 during
  three consecutive semesters (fall/spring) and the intervening summer term at any public
  Arizona community college or university are no longer considered continuously enrolled,
  and must meet requirements of the public Arizona community college or university catalog
  in effect at the time they are readmitted or of any single catalog in effect during
  subsequent terms of continuous enrollment after readmission. Students are not obligated to
  enroll and earn course credit during summer terms, but summer enrollment may be used to
  maintain continuous enrollment status. </p>
  <p>3. Students admitted or readmitted to a public Arizona community college or university
  during a summer term must follow the requirements of the catalog in effect the following
  fall semester or of any single catalog in effect during subsequent terms of continuous
  enrollment. </p>
  <p>4. Students transferring among Arizona public higher education institutions must meet
  the admission requirements, residency requirements, and all curricular and academic
  requirements of the degree-granting institution. </p>
  <p>5. Students under the 1997-98 and prior catalogs must follow the general education
  requirements of those catalogs; they do not have the option of using a subsequent catalog
  for general education purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exceptions to these policies are the prerogative of the college. Students should
contact their college dean&#146;s office for more information.</p>
