<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><b>4-103 (9/83)</b></p>
  <p>A. The universities shall collect at the time of registration the payment
  or promise of payment of only those fees which are required for the proper
  operation of the universities and which are subject to the control of and
  disbursement by the universities.</p>
  <p>B. 1. Each university shall establish procedures to collect outstanding
  obligations owed by students and former students.</p>
  <p>2. Each university shall maintain a system to record all delinquent
  financial obligations owed to that university by students and former students.</p>
  <p>3. Students with delinquent obligations shall not be allowed to register
  for classes, receive cash refunds, or obtain transcripts, diplomas, or
  certificate of degree. The university may allow students to register for
  classes, obtain transcripts, diplomas, or certificate of degree if the
  delinquent obligation is $25 or less.</p>
  <p>4. Unpaid obligations shall remain a matter of record until students and
  former students satisfy their financial obligations or until satisfactory
  arrangements for repayment are made with the university.</p>
  <p>5. The university may write off delinquent financial obligations of
  students according to accepted accounting principles and after appropriate
  collection efforts. No such write-off shall operate to relieve the student for
  liability for the obligation nor shall such write-off entitle the student to
  release of any transcript, diploma, or certificate of degree or to register
  for further university classes until such obligation is actually paid.</p>
  <p>6. Each university shall include this policy in its bulletin or catalog.</p>
