<blockquote>
  <p>Colleges or schools, with the approval of the University faculty and the
  Arizona Board of Regents, establish the minimum number of units needed to
  complete an undergraduate minor administered within that unit. All University
  of Arizona minors require at least 18 units; some minors require more than 18
  units. In most cases, at least nine of the 18 units must be upper-division
  units.</p>
  <p>For additional information about the minimum number of units for a specific
  minor, contact the <a href="../../geninfo/dept/994/dept.html">department</a>
  that administers the minor. See the Catalog's <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">Undergraduate
  Minor Reports</a> page for a list of approved minors and links to their
  respective Requirement Reports, including specific course requirements. Any
  variation from the prescribed content must be approved by the minor
  discipline.</p>
  <p>Each college determines whether or not its degrees must include a minor;
  however, a college may not preclude a student from declaring an existing
  minor. Minors are discipline-based; the discipline that labels the minor
  defines its content. The double use of courses in the minor with
other degree requirements is subject to University General Education, college,
and department policies on double dipping.&nbsp; See the <a href="http://www.gened.arizona.edu/content/general-education-policies-students">General
Education policy</a> and check with your major and minor advisors for
clarification on the double use of any courses. Certification of a minor at the point of degree audit for
  graduation indicates that the student has met the requirements specified by
  the discipline defining the minor.</p>
  <p>Students also have the option of declaring a thematic minor. The thematic
  minor is developed around a theme identified by the student, using courses
  from two or more disciplines. The major advisor must approve all thematic
  minors. For more information about the approval process for thematic minors
  contact your major advisor.</p>
  <p><strong>Courses excluded from the minor</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>freshman composition,</li>
    <li>math courses below Math 124,</li>
    <li>military aerospace studies,</li>
    <li>military or naval science, and</li>
    <li>first-year courses in foreign language and American Sign Language that
      are also used to satisfy the second language requirement in general
      education</li>
  </ul>
