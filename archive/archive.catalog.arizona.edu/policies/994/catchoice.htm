<blockquote>
  <p>The General Catalog is the University's primary official source of
  departmental, college and university-wide information related to academic
  programs. Courses, programs and policies that govern progress towards
  completion of an undergraduate degree are described in the General Catalog.
  Students maintaining <a href="contenrl.htm">continuous enrollment</a> follow
  the requirements outlined by the Catalog in effect when they first enroll in a
  public Arizona community college or university. A student may choose instead
  to follow the requirements outlined by any single Catalog in effect during
  subsequent terms of continuous enrollment. Each student is responsible for
  knowing and abiding by the policies described in the Catalog chosen.</p>
  <p>Students admitted or readmitted to a public Arizona community college or
  university during a summer term follow the requirements of the Catalog in
  effect the following Fall semester. Students transferring among Arizona public
  higher education institutions must meet the admission requirements, residency
  requirements, and all curricular and academic requirements of the
  degree-granting institution.</p>
  <p>See the <font size="3"><a href="../../allcats.html">All UA Academic
  Catalogs</a> listing for links to all online General Catalogs.</font></p>
