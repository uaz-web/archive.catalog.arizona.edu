  <p>General education programs provide breadth of knowledge as a balance and
  complement to the depth provided by the major. General education is designed
  to accomplish several goals: First, to afford students the opportunity to
  learn how different disciplines define, acquire and organize knowledge;
  second, to enhance understanding of the reciprocal influences of Western and
  non-Western cultures; third, to provide a basis for an examination of values;
  fourth to develop analytic, synthetic, linguistic and computational skills
  useful for lifelong learning; and finally, to provide a common foundation for
  wide-ranging dialogue with peers on issues of significance. Taken together,
  the experiences of general education encourage the student to develop a
  critical and inquiring attitude, an appreciation of complexity and ambiguity,
  a tolerance for and empathy with persons of different backgrounds or values
  and a deepened sense of one's own self. In short, the goal of the general
  education program is to prepare students to respond more fully and effectively
  to an increasingly complex world.</p>
  <p><big><strong><a name="college">College-Specific</a> General Education
  Requirements</strong></big></p>
  <p><strong>General education requirements vary across colleges and
  departments.</strong> However, all general education programs at The
  University of Arizona share a common structure. Each requires courses in basic
  skills and competencies, including freshman composition, as well as courses in
  particular study areas, such as biological and physical sciences, arts and
  literature, social sciences, and traditions and cultures. Some colleges have
  Second Language requirements, as well.&nbsp; For college-specific general
  education requirements and courses view the 1997-1998 <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">Academic
  Program Requirements Reports (APRR's)</a> for your college and degree.</p>
  <h3><a name="compreq">Composition/Writing Requirements</a></h3>
  <p><b>General Information</b></p>
  <p>The University of Arizona has long regarded sound training in writing as
  indispensable to the academic development of an educated person; clear,
  intelligent writing is a skill required of all university graduates.
  First-year Composition, the Upper-Division Writing Proficiency Examination,
  and a writing-emphasis course are required of all students.</p>
  <a name="comp">
  <p><b>First-Year Composition</b></p>
  </a><p><font color="#BA0113">(Policy updated 12/05/03:&nbsp; Added options for
  transfer students)</font></p>
  <p>All students working toward degrees must meet the first-year composition
  requirement by completing one of the following sequences: ENGL 100-101-102,
  ENGL 101-102, ENGL 103H-104H, ENGL 106-107-108, ENGL 107-108, ENGL 109H. There
  is no exemption from the first-year composition requirement; any substitutes
  must be approved by the Director of Composition, Department of English. The
  first-year composition requirement may not be satisfied by correspondence
  work.</p>
  <p>Placement in first-year composition takes into account the student's
  performance on two examinations: (1) A written placement essay administered at
  the time a student first registers for a course in composition, (2) the
  English section of the American College Test (ACT) or the verbal score on the
  Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Both of these examinations require fees.
  Students with superior ratings based on the above examinations enroll
  initially in ENGL 103H; students whose scores indicate a need for more
  extensive instruction in writing initially enroll in ENGL 100 and pass this
  course before they enroll in ENGL 101.</p>
  <p>International students write a placement essay and submit a score on the
  Test of English as a Foreign Language. Students whose scores indicate a need
  for more extensive instruction in writing initially enroll in ENGL 106 and
  pass this course before they enroll in ENGL 107. Students who earn a score of
  4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Exam administered by the College Board, or a
  score of 5, 6, or 7 on the International Baccalaureate Examination have the
  option of enrolling in ENGL 109H and satisfying the requirement in one
  semester.</p>
  <p>Transfer students who are admitted with 56 transferable units or who have
  earned a previous bachelor's degree from another institution may satisfy the
  English Composition requirement by submitting to the Writing Program
  coordinator, Modern Languages Building, Room 380, one of the following for
  consideration:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A catalog course description or syllabus for 2 transferable
      composition/writing courses that do not fulfill another UA degree
      requirement.
    <li>A portfolio of 3 - 4 writing samples (an adequate sample consists of 15
      - 20 pages illustrating an analytical, argumentative, or critical response
      to a text) from courses completed at the transfer institution.
    <li>A catalog course description for 1 transferable composition/writing
      course that is not used to satisfy another degree requirement, in addition
      to a portfolio of writing samples (see above).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Upon approval by the Writing Program coordinator of 2 transferable
  composition/writing courses or portfolio of writing samples, the first-year
  English Composition requirement will be satisfied.&nbsp; All questions about
  first-year composition should be directed to:</p>

  <p><b>The Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination</b></a></p>
  <p>Every student must take the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination,
  which is a prerequisite to enrolling in a writing-emphasis course (see below).
  Students may take the exam after they have satisfied the first-year
  composition requirement and accumulated at least 40 but less than 75 credit
  hours toward their degree. Students who have accumulated more than 75 credit
  hours should take the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination as soon
  as possible. Students register for the exam with the University Composition
  Board (Modern Languages 380). Students must have taken the Upper-Division
  Writing-Proficiency Examination before their application for Bachelor's Degree
  Candidacy will be accepted.</p>
  <p>The examination may be taken only once. Results are reported to students
  and to their major departments. Students who earn an evaluation of
  unsatisfactory on the exam usually are required by their department to
  complete further work in composition before registering for writing-emphasis
  courses. They should consult with their academic advisors for specific
  information about their department's requirements.</p>
  <a name="wecourses">
  <p><b>Writing-Emphasis Courses</b></a></p>
  <p>Every undergraduate degree program includes at least one required
  writing-emphasis course. Writing-emphasis courses are regular junior or senior
  level courses in an academic discipline in which at least half the grade
  awarded is determined by written work appropriate to the academic discipline.
  Such courses are identified with the phrase &quot;writing-emphasis
  course&quot; at the end of the course description .<i> </i>Prerequisite to a
  writing-emphasis course is satisfactory performance on the Upper-Division
  Writing-Proficiency Examination or, in the case of students whose papers are
  evaluated as unsatisfactory on the examination, further developmental work in
  writing, as prescribed by an academic advisor.</p>

  <p><b><font size="3">Mathematics Readiness Test</font></b></a></p>
  <p>Prior to taking any mathematics course below the level of 125b at The
  University of Arizona, students must take the math readiness test. The test is<font size="4">
  </font>administered by the Testing Office in Old Main 223 (621-7589) and the
  results are valid for one year. Students without University Credit in the
  prerequisites for 116, 117R, 117S, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125a will be
  required to have an appropriate score on the math readiness test to be
  enrolled in those courses.</p>
