<h2 align="center">Proficiency and Exemption Examinations, <br>
Credit by Examination </h2>

<p>Students may establish credit or proficiency in various disciplines under any of
several modes. They are: 

<ul>
  <li>The Advanced Placement program administered by the College Board </li>
  <li>The Higher Level Examinations of the International Baccalaureate</li>
  <li>The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) (also administered by the College Board) </li>
  <li>Departmental exemption or proficiency examinations </li>
  <li>Special examination for credit or grade </li>
</ul>

<p>In no case may the sum of credits earned through the above examinations and/or
University of Arizona correspondence courses exceed 60 units applied toward an
undergraduate degree. No graduate credit may be established in this manner. </p>

<h3 align="left">Exemption or Proficiency Examinations </h3>

<h4>General Information</h4>

<p>A number of colleges and departments regularly offer exemption or proficiency
examinations covering introductory or basic areas of their disciplines. These examinations
are designed and graded by the individual departments. No credit is awarded on the basis
of successful performance on these, but they allow a student two privileges: (a) the
opportunity of enrolling in advanced-level courses in the area of proficiency; or (b) the
opportunity of satisfying various college or departmental &quot;area&quot; or proficiency
requirements without taking prescribed courses. </p>

<p>Proficiency or exemption examinations for many courses are available to any student
currently enrolled in a degree program at the university. Capable students wishing to
increase their elective freedom are encouraged by university policy to examine the
opportunities provided through the various proficiency examinations. </p>

<p>At the discretion of the department, the proficiency examination may include laboratory
projects or other evidence of satisfactory skills in addition to or instead of the written
examination. A fee is normally charged for these examinations. </p>

<h4>Foreign Language Proficiency Examinations</h4>

<p>It is possible for students to satisfy <a href="profexem.htm#*">language requirements</a> in whole
or in part by passing a noncredit proficiency examination at the two- or four-semester
level*. </p>

<p>Passing the proficiency examination at the required level in a foreign language
fulfills the language requirement in colleges requiring a foreign language. Passing a
course for which the required level is prerequisite also establishes proficiency in that
language. Credit may not be earned merely by passing the proficiency examination. </p>

<p>Foreign students will be allowed credit by transfer in their native language only for
those courses taken during the years equivalent to the United States college years. </p>

<h4>Procedures and General Regulations for Exemption or Proficiency Examinations </h4>

<ul>
  <li>Proficiency or exemption examinations are available only to degree-seeking students. </li>
  <li>In no case does passing an exemption or proficiency examination lower the total number
    of units required for the bachelor's degree. </li>
  <li>In normal circumstances, a student may not take a proficiency examination for the same
    course more than twice. </li>
  <li>Proficiency or exemption examinations are normally given early in the semester or during
    summer orientation. The student must contact the appropriate department concerned for
    additional information and instructions. </li>
  <li>Students wishing to sit for a proficiency or exemption examination in a language not
    normally taught must contact the Office of the Dean of Arts and Sciences for information. </li>
  <li>The exemption or proficiency examinations are administered only on the University of
    Arizona campus. </li>
  <li>The results of exemption or proficiency examinations, if successful, are reported in
    writing directly to the Office of the Registrar, with a copy to the student. </li>
  <li>The student's academic record will be annotated with a statement indicating the student
    passed the proficiency examination at the appropriate level. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Special Exam">Special Examination for Credit or Grade </a></h3>

<p>Any student currently enrolled or previously withdrawn in good standing at the
University of Arizona may earn credit toward an undergraduate degree through the use of
special examinations. The responsibility for preparatory study for these examinations
rests entirely with the student; faculty members are under no obligation to assist with
such preparation. </p>

<p>Special examinations are constructed and administered by the department concerned. They
are designed to reflect and explore the scholastic equivalent of the course, and are more
comprehensive than the usual &quot;final exam.&quot; The examinations may be written or
oral, or both, and they may include course projects, laboratory projects, written reports,
or other evidence of proficiency. </p>

<p>Undergraduate courses currently offered by the University and designated in the catalog
&quot;CDT&quot; may be taken for credit by examination. Courses designated &quot;GRD&quot;
may be taken for grade by examination or credit by examination. Other courses generally
have been excluded from this option; at department discretion, however, any course may be
made available for grade by examination or credit by examination. </p>

<p><strong>Options </strong>

<ul>
  <li><em>Special Examination for Credit:</em> Passing grades, recorded as &quot;CR&quot;
    (credit), become a permanent part of the student's record but are not used in computing
    the cumulative grade average. Failing grades are not recorded. </li>
  <li><em>Special Examination for Grade:</em> All grades, whether passing or failing, are
    permanently recorded and used in computing the cumulative grade average. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Limitations</b> </p>

<p>The credit so earned may not duplicate units already presented for admission to the
University. Nor may the credit be in a course which is equivalent to, or more elementary
than, another course in which the student is enrolled or for which the student has already
received credit. The head of the examining department has the responsibility of
determining the application of this limitation in each student's case. </p>

<p>No credit may be earned by this type of examination for beginning or intermediate
language courses in the native language of the applicant. </p>

<p><strong>Procedures</strong>

<ol>
  <li>Applications for Special Examination for Credit or Special Examination for Grade may be
    obtained from the Registrar. </li>
  <li>The application must be approved by the student's advisor. </li>
  <li>The examining instructor and the head of the examining department must determine the
    eligibility of the applicant and sign the application. </li>
  <li>The application is returned to the Registrar, and the $21-per-unit fee is paid to the
    University Cashier. No department may schedule a special examination until notified by the
    Cashier that the fee has been paid. </li>
  <li>The examination is scheduled by the faculty member responsible, normally during the same
    semester in which the application is made. </li>
  <li>The grade (CR or letter grade) is reported to the Registrar. The examination, together
    with the student's graded examination paper and any appropriate evaluations of oral
    performance or projects, is then filed with the department for at least one year. </li>
  <li>The student may change the type of special examination for those courses designated
    &quot;GRD&quot; in the catalog any time before the scheduled hour of the examination by
    filing a new application. No additional fee will be charged. </li>
</ol>
