<h2 align="center">Collection of Fees Policy </h2>

<p align="center">From <i>Arizona Board of Regents Policy Manual</i> </p>

<p><b>4-103 (9/83)</b> </p>

<p>A. The universities shall collect at the time of registration the payment or promise of
payment of only those fees which are required for the proper operation of the universities
and which are subject to the control of and disbursement by the universities. </p>

<p>B. 1. Each university shall establish procedures to collect outstanding obligations
owed by students and former students. </p>

<p>2. Each university shall maintain a system to record all delinquent financial
obligations owed to that university by students and former students. </p>

<p>3. Students with delinquent obligations shall not be allowed to register for classes,
receive cash refunds, or obtain transcripts, diplomas, or certificate of degree. The
university may allow students to register for classes, obtain transcripts, diplomas, or
certificate of degree if the delinquent obligation is $25 or less. </p>

<p>4. Unpaid obligations shall remain a matter of record until students and former
students satisfy their financial obligations or until satisfactory arrangements for
repayment are made with the university. </p>

<p>5. The university may write off delinquent financial obligations of students according
to accepted accounting principles and after appropriate collection efforts. No such
write-off shall operate to relieve the student for liability for the obligation nor shall
such write-off entitle the student to release of any transcript, diploma, or certificate
of degree or to register for further university classes until such obligation is actually
paid. </p>

<p>6. Each university shall include this policy in its bulletin or catalog.
