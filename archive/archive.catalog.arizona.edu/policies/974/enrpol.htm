<h2 align="center">Credit Definitions and Enrollment Policies</h2>

<h3>University Credit </h3>

<p>University credit is the term used to identify all credit offered by The University of
Arizona with the exception of correspondence credit and <a href="profexem.htm#Special Exam">Special Examination for Credit</a>. Only the grades of
courses taken for University credit and by <a href="profexem.htm#Special Exam">Special
Examination for Grade</a> are used in calculating the grade-point average.</p>

<h3>Definition of Unit of Credit </h3>

<p>Utilizing the definition that an hour of work is the equivalent of 50 minutes of class
time (often called a contact hour) or 60 minutes of independent-study work, university
policy requires at least 45 hours of work by each student for each unit of credit. Contact
hours required for specific types of courses are as follows: 

<ul>
  <li>At least 15 contact hours of recitation, lecture, discussion, seminar, or colloquium, as
    well as a minimum of 30 hours of student homework are required for each unit of student
    credit. </li>
  <li>Workshops require at least 15 through 45 contact hours and the appropriate number of
    homework hours to comprise a total of at least 45 hours of work for each unit of credit. </li>
  <li>Studios require at least 30 contact hours and at least 15 hours of homework for each
    unit of credit. </li>
  <li>Laboratory courses must maintain a minimum of 45 contact hours per unit of credit. </li>
  <li>Field trips are to be counted hour-for-hour as laboratory meetings. </li>
  <li>Each unit of internship or practicum must require a minimum of 45 hours of work. </li>
</ul>

<p>Since it would be virtually impossible for a student to complete satisfactorily 45
hours of work in less than one week, the policy regarding the duration of courses
maintains that a course must cover at least a one-week period for every unit of credit
given. During the summer session, however, 6 units of credit might be given over a
five-week period. </p>

<p>It is understood that, when the official university calendar deviates from these
guidelines, that calendar shall prevail. </p>

<p>It is also understood that the hour requirements specified above represent minimums for
average students and that considerable deviation in excess of these requirements may
occur, particularly at the graduate level. </p>

<p><h3>Graduate Credit for Seniors</h3>
<font color="#CC0000">(Policy updated May 23, 2003: clarification on
the use of 500-level courses toward the bachelor's and graduate degrees, and
the use of graduate and professional transfer courses.)</font></p>

<p>A senior within 15 units of completing requirements for graduation may
register for graduate work if recommended by the head of the department
offering the course and approved by the Dean of the Graduate College. A
petition for Undergraduate Enrollment in Graduate Courses must be filed with
the Graduate College at the time of registration or within 10 days thereafter.
The Dean of the Graduate College will not approve a petition unless the senior
has a <a href="grade.htm#GPA">grade-point-average (GPA)</a> of 3.000 or better
on all <a href="enrpol.htm#top">University Credit</a> and is proceeding toward
graduation as directly as possible. Under such a petition, seniors may enroll
in 500-level courses for undergraduate or graduate credit (not both). Courses
numbered at the 600, 700, and 900 levels are not open to undergraduates.</p>

<p>Just as graduate University Credit may be applied toward a bachelor's
degree (as upper division credit) or a graduate degree (as graduate credit),
graduate or professional level credit earned and transferred from another
institution may be applied toward a baccalaureate degree at the UA only if it
is not used to complete a graduate or professional degree at that institution.
Professional degrees include (but are not limited to) such programs as law and
medicine. Students may petition the acceptance of graduate or professional
credit by submitting a Transfer Credit Appeal, along with a letter from the
graduate or professional college stating that the courses in question were
not/are not being applied toward a graduate or professional degree at that
institution.</p>

<h3>Full-time Student Status</h3>

<p>Full-time status for an undergraduate student varies with the college and study
program, but ordinarily requires a load of at least 12 units per semester. Full-time
status for graduate students is more widely variable, depending upon assistantship or
associateship duties and the composition of the individual student's program. Students in
doubt about their standing should check with the their college dean's office.
