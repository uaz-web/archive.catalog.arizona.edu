<h4 align="center">Grade Appeal</h4>
<p align="center" style="text-align: left">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FF0000; ">(Policy 
revised 11/5/07:&nbsp; clarification on the basis for filing an appeal)</span></p>
<p align="left">The basis for filing a grade appeal 
in an undergraduate course is limited to fundamental fairness in treatment of 
the student by the instructor, as specified by a syllabus conforming to the 
Undergraduate Course Syllabus Policy (<span style="color: red"><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" target="_blank" href="http://policy.arizona.edu">http://web.arizona.edu/~policy/syllabus.shtml</a></span>) 
that is supplied to students at the beginning of the semester, and in light of 
grading of the student by the instructor relative to other students in the same 
course and section.&nbsp; Issues that do not meet these criteria are not appropriate 
for an undergraduate grade appeal.&nbsp; Since graduate courses are not subject to a 
course syllabus policy, grades given in graduate courses may be appealed on the 
basis of fundamental fairness.</p>
  <p>A graduate or undergraduate student may appeal a grade by using the following procedures. Where
  mentioned, the words college, dean, and department head are the department or
  college in which the course being appealed is offered. All timelines refer to
  the first regular (16-week) semester after<i> </i>the semester or summer term in which
  the grade was awarded. Grade appeals are not processed during the summer
  sessions unless the dean determines a case warrants immediate review.</p>
  <p>Written verification of each step below is critical. Steps three, five, and
  seven require the student to submit a written appeal. Therefore, either mail
  the appeal via return receipt or deliver it to the appropriate office and have
  a staff member verify the date and time of delivery. The dean's decision on
  whether or not the deadlines have been met is final. The dean has authority to
  extend the deadlines, but only in extraordinary circumstances shall the appeal
  extend beyond the first regular semester.</p>
  <p><b>Step 1</b>: Within the first five
  weeks of the regular semester
	<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">after the 
	semester in which the grade was awarded, or sooner if possible</span>, the student should discuss the concerns with the course
  instructor, stating the reasons for questioning the grade. If the instructor
  is a teaching assistant/associate and this interview does not resolve the
  difficulty, the student shall discuss the problem with the person in charge of
  the course.</p>
  <p><b>Step 2</b>: Within the first five
  weeks of the regular semester
	<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">after the 
	semester in which the grade was awarded, or sooner if possible</span>, the student shall go to the college dean's office to
  obtain any requisite forms and to review directions. The student must attest
  in writing that s/he has informed the instructor s/he intends to file a grade
  appeal.</p>
  <p><b>Step 3</b>: Within the first five
  weeks of the regular semester
	<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">after the 
	semester in which the grade was awarded, or sooner if possible</span>, the student shall carefully formulate an appeal in
  writing, and submit it to the instructor with a copy to the department head.</p>
  <p><b>Step 4</b>: Within two weeks from
  the date of receipt of the student's written statement, the instructor shall
  respond to the student in writing. The instructor should explain the grading
  procedures and how the grade in question was determined as well as other
  issues raised in the student's statement.</p>
  <p><b>Step 5</b>: If the instructor is
  not available or does not resolve the matter within the two-week period, the
  student shall, within one week thereafter, readdress and submit the written
  appeal to the department head.</p>
  <p><b>Step 6</b>: The department head
  has two weeks to consider the student's written statement, the instructor's
  written statement, and confer with each. The department head may not change the grade, 
	but shall inform the instructor and the
  student in writing of his/her recommendation. If a grade change is
  recommended, the instructor may refuse to accept the recommendation. The
  instructor shall notify the department head and the student in writing of
  his/her decision.</p>
  <p><b>Step 7</b>: If the department
  head does not act on or resolve this matter to the student's satisfaction within a two-week period, the
  student shall, within one week thereafter, readdress and submit the written
  appeal to the dean.</p>
<p><b>Step 8</b>: <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">The dean 
shall review the student’s appeal and take appropriate action.&nbsp; If the basis of 
the appeal is the fundamental fairness of treatment of the student by the 
instructor, the dean should convene a committee to review the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Valid 
reasons for convening an appeal committee include, but are not limited to:&nbsp; a 
violation of University policy, a failure to follow published course policies, a 
lack of consistency within the student’s course section, or a dispute over the 
factual accuracy of graded work.&nbsp; The following are NOT reasons that should be 
brought to a committee: a disagreement with published course policies, 
differences in classroom policies or grading schemes in different courses or 
between different sections of the same course, or a grade’s impact on a 
student’s academic progress, athletic eligibility, or eligibility for veteran’s 
benefits.</span></p>
  <p><b>Step 9</b>: When appropriate, the dean shall
  convene a committee to review the case. The committee consists of five
  members. Faculty representatives include one from the department of the
  instructor concerned, and two from closely related departments or colleges.
  The student council of the college provides two student representatives.
  Student representatives shall be full-time upper-division undergraduate
  students for appeals by undergraduate students or full-time graduate students
  for appeals by graduate students. If the college does not have an appropriate
  student council, the ASUA or GPSC shall appoint the student members. All student
  members must be in good academic standing in that college.</p>
  <p>Within the structure provided by the dean, the committee shall design its
  own rules of operation and select a chair other than the faculty
  representative from the department concerned. The student and instructor shall
  represent themselves. The committee may, or may not
  <ul>
    <li>meet separately with the student, the instructor, and the department
      head</li>
    <li>request each party to submit a brief written summary statement of the
      issues, and/or</li>
    <li>interview other persons who have relevant information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If feasible, the committee should meet with the student and the instructor
  together in an attempt to resolve the difference. The committee shall consider
  all aspects of the case before making its recommendation. The committee shall
  make a written report with recommendations and provide copies to the student,
  the instructor, the department head, and the dean.</p>
  <p><b>Step 10</b>: The dean shall make a
  final decision after full consideration of the committee's recommendation and
  within four weeks of receiving the student's appeal. The dean has the
  authority to change the grade 
	<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">to a different 
	credit-bearing grade, which includes regular grades (A, B, C, D, E), 
	alternative grades (S, P), or optional grades (P, F), depending on the 
	course grading system and the system chosen by the student at registration.
	</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">T</span>he registrar shall accept the dean's
  decision. The department head, the instructor, and the student shall be
  notified in writing of the dean's decision.</p>
