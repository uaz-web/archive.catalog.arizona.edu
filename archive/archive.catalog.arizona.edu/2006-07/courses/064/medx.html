 -- Preparation for Clinical Medicine
 </b>&nbsp;(12 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; The clinical companion course to the basic sciences beginning first week of medical school and continuing until the beginning of the first clinical rotation. The overall objective is to provide students with skills, behavioral traits, attitudes and knowledge necessary to enter clinical clerkships. PCM is divided into three main course segments: 1. Patient evaluation, including physical examination, clinical interviewing, specialty examinations and write-ups. During these segments students interact with patient instructors and also spend three semesters interviewing, specialty examinations and write-ups. During these segments students interact with patient instructors and also spend three semesters interacting with a physician-preceptor. (LCC- longitudinal Clinical Curriculum): 2. Clinical correlation's (clinical problem solving) with basic science courses; and 3. Free-standing course segments including cpr, and patient care skills workshop. At the completion of PCM, students will have achieved a prescribed level of skill in data collection, definition of clinical problems, and a logical approach to differential diagnosis. No grade is given until the full 12 units are completed. At the beginning of year IV, PCM administers the OSCE, a clinical competency exam required for graduation.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#medical">Medical grades</a> are awarded for this course: S P F K.<br><b>Prerequisite(s):</b>&nbsp; consent of instructor.<br><b>May be repeated:</b>&nbsp; an unlimited number of times, consult your department for details and possible restrictions.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall, Spring.<!--MED 801 ends-->
