  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
  <p>The College of Nursing offers a professional program leading to the
  Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree and graduate programs leading to the
  Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees with a major in
  nursing.&nbsp; The college also offers a B.S.N./M.S. pathway for registered
  nurses who graduated from associate degree nursing programs.&nbsp; A second
  degree B.S.N./M.S. pathway may be offered in the near future for students who
  are college graduates holding a baccalaureate or higher degree in a
  non-nursing field.</p>
  <p>The college is accredited by the National League for Nursing and approved
  by the Arizona State Board of Nursing. Upon recommendation of the faculty,
  graduates of the college will be admitted to the licensing examination
  administered by the state board. Graduation from the College of Nursing is not
  the sole criterion for obtaining a license to practice nursing in Arizona.
  Licensing requirements are the exclusive responsibility of the State Board of
  Nursing. Graduates must satisfy licensure requirements independently of degree
  requirements.
  <p>Prospective students should consult the College of Nursing for current
  information about undergraduate programs. For information regarding graduate
  study, please see the Graduate Catalog.</p>
  <p>Nursing students are preparing for a profession which is exacting and in
  which they must take responsibility for the lives and well-being of
  others.&nbsp; The program which leads to the B.S.N. degree prepares the
  graduate to begin practice as a professional nurse, and to undertake graduate
  study in nursing. The curriculum is composed of prenursing and general
  education courses, which are taken in University College, followed by the
  professional nursing major. After having completed the prenursing phase of the
  program, students are admitted selectively to the College of Nursing to begin
  the nursing major in Fall or Spring. A minimum of 30 units of the nursing
  major must be University credit course work. Selection of an optional minor
  should be made in consultation with a College of Nursing advisor.</p>
  <p>Any entering freshman who meets University admission requirements may be
  admitted to University College for the prenursing portion of the program.</p>
  <p>Transfer students must meet the same University admission requirements.
  They may complete all freshman and sophomore general education requirements as
  listed in the nursing program at another college or university, or may present
  a combination of transfer and University of Arizona courses for consideration
  for admission to the nursing major. Before a decision to transfer to The
  University of Arizona is made, prospective transfer students are strongly
  advised to have their previous course work evaluated by the College of
  Nursing.</p>
  <p><b>General Education Program:</b></p>
  <p>All undergraduate students are required to complete a common general
  education program. Designed to provide a foundation for university learning,
  the program develops students' creative and analytical skills and integrates
  knowledge across university disciplines.</p>
  <p><strong>Admission to the Professional Nursing Major:</strong></p>
  <p>There is a selection process before any student can be accepted into the
  College of Nursing for the professional nursing courses. To be considered for
  admission to the baccalaureate program, a student must have: removed any high
  school deficiencies; completed designated prerequisites; earned a 2.750
  grade-point average in designated prerequisites; and earned a cumulative
  grade-point average of 2.750. Applicants must also be in good physical and
  mental health; otherwise, they may be denied admission or, once admitted,
  recommended for withdrawal.</p>
  <p>Completion of prerequisite courses with a 2.750 average does not assure a
  student of admission to the professional nursing courses. The number of
  applicants admitted to the professional courses is limited by the resources of
  the college. Admission to the professional phase of the program is
  competitive.&nbsp; A grade-point average considerably above 3.00 is normally
  required. Admission criteria for the College of Nursing are periodically
  reviewed. Consult with the College of Nursing for current information.</p>
  <p>All transfer students must have a minimum 2.750 average on all freshman and
  sophomore courses for both University of Arizona and transfer credits for
  consideration for admission to the college. Students who have done well at
  other nursing schools may be permitted to transfer to The University of
  Arizona. A letter from the dean or director of the nursing school stating that
  the applicant is in good standing and eligible to continue nursing studies at
  that institution is required.</p>
  <p>All students entering the College of Nursing are required to have basic
  computer knowledge, obtained in formal high school or college courses or
  self-taught.</p>
  <p>Students seeking acceptance to the College of Nursing for a Fall semester
  need to file the special application form, obtained directly from the college,
  by December 1 of the previous year in which they desire to enter and can
  expect to hear of their status in early April. Students planning to enter the
  college in a Spring semester must file this application by July 1 of the
  previous year and can expect a response in early October. The College of
  Nursing does not maintain a waiting list. Students wishing to reapply must
  contact the College of Nursing regarding reapplication.</p>
  <p>In addition to these requirements, registered nurses from associate degree
  schools of nursing must hold a current, valid Arizona license to practice
  nursing. For these applicants, acceptance of transfer credits will be
  considered on an individual basis.</p>
  <p>Students are required to take the University of Arizona Writing-Proficiency
  Examination before starting their classes in the College of Nursing. Students
  who have an unsatisfactory rating on the examination will be required to
  complete developmental work acceptable to the College of Nursing.</p>
  <p><b>Undergraduate Program:</b></p>
  <p>Once admitted to the major, the student must be full time, attending five
  consecutive semesters. During these semesters the student must be enrolled for
  all required courses.</p>
  <p>Clinical laboratories are in a variety of community settings. All students
  in the clinical nursing courses are required to provide their own
  transportation to the areas where they are assigned for patient-care
  experience.</p>
  <p>A candidate for the degree of B.S.N. must fulfill the requirements both in
  number and kind of units as outlined in the catalog under which the student
  has chosen to graduate. The graduation average must be 2.000 or better, with
  an average of 2.000 or better for all work undertaken in the major field at
  The University of Arizona</p>
  <p>Graduation from the College of Nursing is not the sole criterion for
  obtaining a license to practice nursing in Arizona. Licensing requirements are
  the exclusive responsibility of the State Board of Nursing. Graduates must
  satisfy licensure requirements independently of degree requirements.</p>
  <p><b>Grading Policy for Nursing Courses:</b></p>
  <p>The grade of &quot;D&quot; is unacceptable for courses in the nursing
  major, including prenursing courses, as it does not reflect acceptable
  performance. Prenursing students who do not complete a required course(s) with
  a grade &quot;C&quot; or better must repeat the course. Students already
  enrolled in the College of Nursing who do not complete a required course(s)
  with a grade &quot;C&quot; or better, are not eligible to progress in the
  professional nursing major. The student may be permitted to repeat the course
  for credit. Students who receive grades below &quot;C&quot; in two courses
  will be disqualified from the college.</p>
  <p><b>Honors:</b></p>
  <p>The college participates in the Honors Program.</p>
