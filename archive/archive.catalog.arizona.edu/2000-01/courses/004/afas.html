 Models of Resistance, Post 16th Cent. African Liberation Movements in Southeast
 </b> (3)  I There were actually several "Souths" during  the Holocaust of Enslavement. However, courses taught in the era of African enslavement have tended to focus on the northern most regions, such as Virginia, which are often taken to represent-if not constitute-the South. This course looks at the other "South" and the French and Spanish colonizers of  South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. It offers a different perspective of the beginnings of the Great Enslavement and compares and contrasts the lives and struggles of enslaved, freed, and self-emancipated Africans in the Southwest during the tenure of Spain.

 African American Politics
 </b> (3)  I This course is designed to illumine the political economy of the African American community in the United States, with special attention to issues of race, politics, class and gender.  Major themes in the course will focus on the struggles of African American people for justice from the period of reconstruction through the civil rights and post-civil rights eras.

<p>
<p><b><a name="AFAS304B" >AFAS 304B</a>
 The Social Construction of Race: Blackness
 </b> (3)  I In constructing this course, the recognition of whiteness/blackness is not solely a reactionary response to challenges from persons/non-persons of color; it is also a reflection of the need to provide a narrative of whiteness/blackness that intends an understanding of the notion of
whiteness/blackness as a racial category and the implications of this categorization and association. For example, naming whiteness displaces it from the unmarked, unnamed status that is itself an effect of dominance. Within the particular, disciplines of anthropology and ethnic studies, whiteness, blackness and race have come to be earnest subjects of study. Being white or black in the 1990's, however, is far from straightforward. It is riddled with ambiguity and marked by a general sense of racial angst as to what it means to be white or black. This course will attempt to respond to the question: what does it mean to be black/white in our global climate? This is a temporary course offered Fall 2000 only.   P, AFAS 304A is not prerequisite to AFAS 304B.
<p>
<p><b><a name="AFAS306" >AFAS 306</a>
 African-American Autobiographies:  Women and Their Histories
 </b> (3)  I II Students will gain insight into the historical and cultural factors  that have created, and continue to perpetuate gender and ethnic inequity. Students will come to understand African American writers,  particularly women, as historical agents and self-defined individuals. While the course will emphasize the multiple roles of African American women, as portrayed autobiographically it also incorporates the historical struggles of those around them. It is my goal that through the course material students will see how African Americans are constantly recreating themselves in the face of adversity. (Identical with  W S 306).
<p>
<p><b><a name="AFAS307" >AFAS 307</a>
 Race, Ethnicity and Culture
 </b> (3)  I The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to theoretical and epistemological issues cognate to the ideas of race, ethnicity, and culture.  Discussions will examine the concepts of  race, not only in terms of their sociological meaningfulness, but also in terms of cognitive significance within human culture.

<p>
<p><b><a name="AFAS342" >AFAS 342</a>
 Writers, Women and the Gods: The Caribbean Novel
 </b> (3) [Rpt./ 2]  I  In order to conceptualize the way gender and ethnicity has  shaped women's lives in the public and private domain students will "hear" the voices of African American women in ethnography, history  and literature as we discuss the Africana concepts of life, health, beauty and family. The experiences of these women, as expressed in  literature have become "formidable" presences in African American culture and history. The self-expression and self-definition, expressed  by African American womens' voices have generated social and political changes in American history that have also impacted the dominant  Euro-American culture of American society.  (Identical with  ENGL 342,  W S 342).
