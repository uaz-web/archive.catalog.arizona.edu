<p><b><a name="PSIO195A" >PSIO 195A</a>
 -- How the Body Works
 </b> (1)  I This course will consist of informal lectures and discussions on the function of the body. By examining how the body responds during a coordinated activity, namely muscular exercise, students will develop an understanding of basic functions of the major organs of the body. The discussions will take place both in the classroom, and via a "computer Enhanced Learning Linkage" (CELL). Students will learn how to use CELL to interact with faculty members and with each other, and to gain access to an information repository. One goal will be for students to use
 CELL to select a faculty member and arrange a visit to the faculty laboratory. Each student will then deposit a report of their visit on CELL to share with the other students.

 -- Introduction to Systems Neurophysiology
 </b> (2)  II An interdisciplinary overview of selected aspects of systems neurophysiology specifically designed for graduate students in physiological sciences who do not specialize in neuroscience. The course focuses upon the generalized mammalian nervous system, with occasional reference to lower vertebrate and invertebrate systems. The course focuses upon key features of segmental (spinal, periphery sensory afferent, neuroeffector) and suprasegmental (brain) mechanisms that control and/or modulate sensorimotor, cardiorespiratory, and endocrine systems. Open to non-majors.   P, PSIO 503 or PSIO 588 with consent of instructor.
