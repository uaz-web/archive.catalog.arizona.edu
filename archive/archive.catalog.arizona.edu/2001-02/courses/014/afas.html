 -- The Social Construction of Race: Blackness
 </b>&nbsp;(3 units) <br><b>Temporary course:</b>&nbsp; offered during Fall 2001 only.<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; In constructing this course, the recognition of Whiteness/Blackness is not solely a reactionary response to challenges from persons/non-persons of color; it is also a reflection of the need to provide a narrative of Whiteness/Blackness that intends an understanding of the notion of Whiteness/Blackness as a racial category and the implications of this categorization and association. For example, naming Whiteness displaces it from the unmarked, unnamed status that isitself an effect of dominance. Within the particular, disciplines of Anthropology and Ethnic Studies, Whiteness, Blackness and Race have come to be earnest subjects of study. Being White or Black in the 1990's, however, is far from straightforward. It is riddled with ambiguity and makred by a general sense of racial angst as to what it means to be White or Black. This course
will attempt to respond to the question: what does it mean to be Black/White in our global climate?<!--AFAS304B ends-->

While the course will emphasize the multiple roles of African American women, as portrayed autobiographically it also incorporates the historical struggles of those around them. It is my goal that through the course material students will see how African Americans are constantly recreating themselves in the face of adversity.<br><b>Identical to:</b>&nbsp;   W S 306.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall, Spring.<!--AFAS306 ends-->
