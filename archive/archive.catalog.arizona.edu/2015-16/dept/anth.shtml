<p>The School of Anthropology is in
    the <a href="/2015-16/dept/SBS.shtml">College of Social and Behavioral Sciences</a>.</p>
  <p>The science of anthropology is the study of human beings, their origins,
  thought, and behavior. The School of Anthropology offers graduate and
  undergraduate course work in four subdisciplines as well as
  specialized training for field research. Special internships and independent
  studies in museology are available through the Arizona State Museum. The
  Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology is a center for applied
  anthropological research in the American Southwest and similar multicultural
  and ecological settings elsewhere in the world. The school cooperates with
  the Arizona Health Sciences Center in offering a program in medical
  anthropology.</p>
  <p><b> Anthropology BA</b></p>
  <p>The Bachelor of Arts program gives students a broad overview of the 
  discipline: archaeology, physical and cultural anthropology, and linguistic 
  anthropology.&nbsp; Students first take a common set of courses which provide
  basic training in all four subdisciplines. The student may
  then select one of three programs: (1) a general program requiring
  upper-division work in each of the four subdisciplines; (2) a special program
  that requires upper-division course work in each of two subdisciplines; or (3)
  a topical or a real specialization approved by the undergraduate advisor.</p>
<p><strong>Anthropology BS</strong></p>
<p>The Bachelor of Science program focuses on tracks in Archaeological Science 
and Human Biology which span the social, behavioral, natural and physical 
sciences. The two tracks draw on a variety of methods and theories from the 
sciences to provide insights on the evolution and nature of global human 
diversity. The BS provides 1) an undergraduate education that will make students 
more competitive for future graduate study in the social and natural sciences; 
2) a wide range of undergraduate research opportunities; and 3) specialized 
training that increases employment opportunities in applied fields (e.g., in 
cultural resources management and the health professions).</p>
