	<p class="auto-style3">The University of Arizona supports students who are members of the United States  armed forces and reserve units.&nbsp; An  undergraduate or graduate student who is a member of the U.S. military,  National Guard or other armed forces reserve unit who is called or ordered to  active duty elsewhere may be granted a Military Leave of Absence (MLOA) from  the University for the period of active duty and up to one year after returning  from active duty.&nbsp; Students with the MLOA need not apply for readmission or  pay readmission fees.&nbsp; MLOA allows those  students to preregister for classes during their priority registration period  prior to the term when they plan to return to campus.&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="auto-style3">The MLOA application is  available online from the <img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://registrar.arizona.edu/registrarforms">Registrar&rsquo;s Office</a> forms site.&nbsp; The  completed application, to be submitted to the Registration &amp; Transcripts  Office in Administration 210 prior to the student&rsquo;s departure from the University, must be accompanied by a copy of the military  orders indicating the date on which  the student must report for active duty elsewhere.&nbsp; When students are called to active duty after  classes begin, they should 
	withdraw from all of their classes by submitting a Complete Withdrawal, in 
	addition to filing the MLOA for subsequent  terms.&nbsp; If students receive financial aid  and/or live in a UA residence hall, they are responsible for contacting the <img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="https://financialaid.arizona.edu/">Office  of Student Financial Aid</a> and/or <img src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15"><a href="http://www.life.arizona.edu/">Office of  Residence Life</a>.</p>
