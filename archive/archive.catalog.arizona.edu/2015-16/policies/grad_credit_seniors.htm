	<p align="center" class="auto-style2">3/23/15 Update:&nbsp; New procedure 
	for undergraduates to enroll in a graduate course.</p>

		<p>A senior may
  register for a graduate course for either undergraduate or graduate credit 
		with approval from the course instructor and the major advisor (for 
		undergraduate credit) or the head of the department offering the course 
		(for graduate credit).&nbsp; Additionally, juniors or seniors in the 
		Honors Program may register for 500-level courses for undergraduate 
		Honors credit with instructor and major advisor approval.&nbsp; An 
		undergraduate who has been admitted to an
		<a href="amp.htm">Accelerated Master's Program (AMP)</a> may request enrollment in a 
		limited number of 500- or 600-level courses to be counted toward the 
		bachelor's requirements and also toward the requirements for the 
		master's degree; see the 
		<a href="amppolicies.html">AMP
		</a>for details.&nbsp; Approval of the instructor, major 
		advisor, and department head is needed to enroll for AMP 
		credit.&nbsp; An 
		<a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">Undergraduate Enrollment in Graduate Courses</a> form must 
		be submitted to the Registrar with the needed signatures in 
		order to enroll in the course.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>The Registrar will not process the graduate course enrollment unless the 
	senior has a <a href="gpa.htm">grade-point-average (GPA)</a> of 3.000 or better on all 
	<a href="definiti.htm#ucredit">University 
	Credit </a>and is proceeding toward graduation as directly as possible.&nbsp; 
	Qualified seniors may enroll in 500-level courses for undergraduate or 
	graduate credit (not both).&nbsp; Courses numbered at the 600-level are not 
	open to undergraduates, with the exception of seniors admitted to an
	<a href="amppolicies.html">Accelerated Master's Program (AMP)</a><a href="http://sgpp.arizona.edu/33-ba-law-juris-doctor">.</a>&nbsp; Courses at the 700 and 900 
		levels are not available to undergraduates.</p>
<p>When academic policy questions arise for undergraduates taking 500-level 
courses, see the <a href="guiding.htm">Guiding Principle on the Application of Graduate or 
Undergraduate Policies.</a></p>
<p>Just as graduate University Credit may be applied toward a bachelor's degree
(as upper division credit) or a graduate degree (as graduate credit), graduate
or professional level credit earned and transferred from another institution may
be applied toward a baccalaureate degree at the UA only if it is not used to
complete a graduate or professional degree at that institution. Professional
degrees include (but are not limited to) such programs as law and medicine.
Students may petition the acceptance of graduate or professional credit by
submitting a Transfer Credit Appeal, along with a letter from the graduate or
professional college stating that the courses in question were not/are not being
applied toward a graduate or professional degree at that institution.</p>
