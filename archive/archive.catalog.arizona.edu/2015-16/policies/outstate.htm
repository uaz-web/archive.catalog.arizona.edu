<h4 align="center">Completion of the UA General Education Requirements<br>
with Transfer Courses</h4>
  <p>Transfer credits from other accredited institutions earned before a student'sinitial enrollment at the University
  will be applied to the student'sUA <a href="../gened.html"> General Education</a> requirements as decided by
  the <a href="../dept/aaindex.html"> college</a> declared by the student at the time of initial admission. 
  Transfer credits earned by UA students will be applied to the General Education requirements by the college of the 
  student'sprimary major at the time the courses are taken.  
  Those decisions will be honored by a student'ssubsequent colleges, if
  any. With a change of major, the student is responsible for completing any additional or higher level General Education
  requirements as specified by the new major.</p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles for Transfer Course Work</b><br />
<hr /> 
		<ol>
			<li>The <a href="agec.htm">Arizona General Education Curriculum (AGEC)</a> is an appropriate path for Arizona community college students
   in most majors to complete the University of Arizona'sGeneral Education Requirements, with the additional need to 
   establish the second language proficiency requirement.  
   Students with a certified AGEC will have satisfied the lower-division General Education requirements in accordance
   with statewide transfer policies. </li>
			<li>The
			<a href="../../2011-12/policies/igetc.html">
			Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC</a>) is 
			an appropriate path for California community college students to 
			satisfy most of the University of Arizona's General Education 
			Requirements, with the possible addition of 1 - 2 laboratory science 
			courses, a diversity emphasis course, and the second language 
			proficiency. </li>
			<li>The University of Arizona Tier One and Two curriculum is the recommended path for students beginning at the
   University of Arizona. </li>
			<li>The University of Arizona will apply up to the maximum number of transfer course credits while maintaining the
   underlying principle of its General Education curriculum; that is, that each student will experience a coherent,
   consistent foundational body of knowledge. </li>
			<li>Arizona public community college courses that satisfy the defined AGEC 
			subject areas will apply to the University'sFoundations, Tier One 
			and/or Tier Two study areas in accordance with approved
			<a href="cc_transfers.htm">
			guidelines</a>. </li>
			<li>Transfer credit should be applied for all students according to the same guidelines regardless of where the work is earned.
   [Note:  AP/CLEP/IB credit will be treated identically with transfer credit.] 
			</li>
			<li>Demonstration of proficiency in a second language is a graduation requirement. 
			</li>
			<li>The University of Arizona will apply transfer courses that are 
			deemed equivalent to UA courses that satisfy Foundations, Tier One 
			and Tier Two Requirements in accordance with approved
			<a href="4_year_transfers.htm">guidelines</a>.</li>
