<p><strong>Changes To/ From UA Online</strong></p>
	<p>Students may change from a degree or certificate program offered on one of the physical UA campuses (e.g., UA Main, UA South) 
to a UA Online degree program or vice versa if this change will enhance their ability to make progress toward a University of 
Arizona degree.&nbsp; Circumstances that would warrant a change to/from UA 
	Online include, but are not limited to, a 
	physical relocation, a change of academic program to one that's not 
offered by that campus, or the need for more flexibility due to work, family or 
other pressures.&nbsp; A change such as this ordinarily occurs infrequently 
	during a student's undergraduate career or during a student's graduate 
	career. </p>
	<p>Students changing to/from <a target="_parent" href="../catinfo.html#seal"><img alt="External Link" border="0" height="15" src="/2011-12/images/globe-external.gif" width="15"></a><a href="http://uaonline.arizona.edu/">UA Online (ONLN)</a> should be carefully advised of 
	the implications for such a change, since there are many considerations, 
	including course selection, tuition and fees, financial aid, etc.&nbsp; 
	</p>

	for the program offered by the new campus must initiate the Change of Campus 
	request for the student.&nbsp; Those requests are processed by the 
	Registrar's Office.</li>
		<li><strong>Graduate students.&nbsp; </strong>For students wishing to 
		change the campus but NOT the degree/certificate program, the academic 
		program coordinator or director of graduate studies for the program must 
		initiate the Change of Campus request.&nbsp; Those requests are 
		processed by the Graduate College.&nbsp; Graduate students wishing to 
		change campus AND the degree/certificate program must reapply, using the 
		Graduate Admissions Application,<a target="_parent" href="../catinfo.html#seal"><img alt="External Link" border="0" height="15" src="/2011-12/images/globe-external.gif" width="15"></a>

	</ul>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Students enrolled in UA Online may only 
	register for courses offered by UA Online.&nbsp; UA Online courses are 
	restricted to UA Online students. &nbsp; </p>
	<p><strong>Changes Between UA Physical Campuses</strong></p>
	<p>Students interested in changing their primary campus--the campus offering 
	their degree program--should see the <a target="_parent" href="../catinfo.html#seal"><img alt="External Link" border="0" height="15" src="/2011-12/images/globe-external.gif" width="15"></a><a href="http://advising.arizona.edu/content/academic-advisor-directory" target="_parent">academic advisor</a> for the program at the 
	new campus (e.g., UA South, UA Main) to discuss the implications of such a 
	change.&nbsp; There is no limit on changes between physical campuses. Changes to/from UA South are 
	processed in UA South-Student Services.</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; Students may enroll in some courses offered 
	at another physical campus without changing their primary campus.</p>
