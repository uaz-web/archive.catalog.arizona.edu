<p><b>* NOTE:</b> For house numbered courses with a choice of grading systems (senior 
capstone, colloquium, etc.), an instructor may have the option of awarding 
regular grades only (A,B,C,D,E) or the combination of special and regular grades 
(S,P,C,D,E), as departmental policy dictates.&nbsp; However, in any single class 
offering, all registrants must be graded by the same system.</p>

<p><b><br>
  K&nbsp;Grade, <a name="K">Course in Progress</a>:</b></p>
<p>K for non-900-level courses:&nbsp; if a course requires more than one term for completion, the grade of K is awarded
for each term except the final term.&nbsp; The final term is awarded a non-K
grade appropriate to the grading scheme for the course (see regular and
alternative grading above).&nbsp; For example, a course that continues for
3 terms would receive the permanent grade of K for the first 2 terms, while the final
term would receive a non-K grade appropriate to the grading scheme for the
course.&nbsp; Course re-registration is not required.</p>
<p>K grade for 900 through 925 <a href="house.htm#900">house
numbered courses</a> and graduate level English writing project courses (e.g. ENGL
501, 604, &amp; 609):&nbsp; the grade of K is awarded by the instructor for
each term when
  the course continues for longer than one term.&nbsp; Once the course is
completed the K grades are replaced with permanent non-K grades appropriate to the grading scheme for the
course.&nbsp; For example, a course that continues for 3 terms would receive
temporary K grades for the first 2 terms.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the course is completed
successfully in the 3rd term all 3 terms then receive the same permanent non-K
grade appropriate to the grading scheme for the course.&nbsp; Students must
register for
  these courses each term, as needed.&nbsp; Time-limit for completion of such work for full credit
  for the master's degree is 6 years; for the doctoral degree, 10 years.</p>

<p>
<b><a name="passfail">Pass/Fail Option</a> for Undergraduates:</b></p>

<p>For certain courses, a qualified student may elect to register under the
  pass/fail option. Under such registration, the only final grades available to
  the student are P (pass) or F (fail).&nbsp; To receive
the grade of P, the student must be doing work comparable to a D or better.&nbsp;
If a course is taken under the pass/fail option, the grade of P or F will
  be permanently recorded.&nbsp; If the course is passed, the units of credit will be applied toward
  graduation.&nbsp; Pass/fail grades are NOT included in the GPA.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students may elect to take courses under the pass/fail option
  only after they have attained sophomore standing and only if they have earned
  grade-point-averages (GPAs) of 2.000 or better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Courses taken under the pass/fail option must be electives only, and may
  not be used to fulfill general education, major, minor, or other specified curriculum
  requirements.</p>
  <p>Students registering for a course under the pass/fail option must meet the
  prerequisites or otherwise satisfy the instructor of their ability to take the
  course.</p>
  <p>Undergraduate students may register under the pass/fail option for not more
  than 2 courses per semester up to a maximum of 12 courses.&nbsp; Further, they
  must carry a minimum of 12 course units graded with regular grades during each
  term in which they take courses under the pass/fail option.&nbsp; Any
  exceptions to this policy must be approved by the student's academic dean.</p>
  <p>Students may change from pass/fail enrollment to enrollment for a regular
  grade, or vice versa, only during the time period prior to the last day of the
  fourth calendar week (Fall and Spring) during which classes are held, except with special
  permission of the student's college dean.</p>
<p>Each department decides which of its courses will be available under the
  pass/fail option.&nbsp; Further, the instructor of the course must approve 
when it is offered for pass/fail. The instructor's class roster will serve as 
notification of any students enrolled in the class under the pass/fail option.</p>
<p>Courses that are available for pass/fail are designated as such in the Schedule
of Classes as &quot;<b>Available:</b> Pass/Fail.&quot;</p>
  <p>Student Teaching:&nbsp; pass/fail grades are the only grades available for
  FSHD 489, TTE 493A, and TTE 493B.
  Enrollment in these courses will not reduce the amount for which a student can
  otherwise enroll under the pass/fail option.</p>
  <p><b>Pass/Fail Option for Graduate Students:&nbsp; </b> </p>

			<p>For certain courses, a graduate student may elect to register under the Pass/Fail option. 
			Under such registration, the only final grades available to the student are P (pass) or F (fail).  
			To receive the grade of P, the student must be doing work comparable to a C or better. 
			If a course is taken under the Pass/Fail option, the grade of P or F will be permanently recorded.
		  If the course is passed, the units of credit may be applied toward the degree at the discretion of the student'smajor advisor. 
		  Pass/Fail grades are NOT included in the GPA.</p>
<p>Students registering for a course under the Pass/Fail option must meet the prerequisites 
or otherwise satisfy the instructor of their ability to take the course.</p>
<p>Students may register under the Pass/Fail option for not more than 2 courses per semester. 
Students may change from Pass/Fail enrollment to enrollment for a regular grade, or vice versa, 
only during the time period prior to the last day of the fourth calendar week (Fall and Spring) 
during which classes are held, except with special permission of the Dean, Graduate College.</p>
<p>The department determines which of its courses will be available under the Pass/Fail option, 
but this is subject to approval by the instructor teaching the course. Graduate students may take 
courses offered by the College of Law for Pass/Fail for graduate credit. Graduate students who need to 
complete admission deficiencies or who wish to take undergraduate courses for Pass/Fail, may do, so but 
they will not earn graduate credit for those courses. The instructor shall be informed by the Office of 
the Registrar which students are enrolled under the Pass/Fail option.</p>
<p>Courses that are available for Pass/Fail are designated as such in the Schedule of Classes as "Available: Pass/Fail."</p>

<p><span style="color:black">The grade of <b>I</b> may be awarded only at the 
end of a term, when all but a minor portion of the course work has been 
satisfactorily completed. The grade of <b>I</b> is not to be awarded in place of 
a failing grade or when the student is expected to repeat the course; in such a 
case, a grade other than <b>I </b>must be assigned.&nbsp; Students should make 
arrangements with the instructor to receive an incomplete grade before the end 
of the term.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">Instructors are encouraged to use the 
<a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">Report 
of Incomplete Grade</a> form as a contract with the student as to what course 
work must be completed by the student for the <b>I</b> grade to be removed and 
replaced with a grade. On the form, the instructor states:&nbsp; (1) which 
assignments or exams should be completed and when; (2) how this work will be 
graded; and (3) how the student's course grade will be calculated. Both the 
instructor and student sign this agreement and both should retain copies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">After the course work is completed, the instructor 
should assign the appropriate grade on the UAccess Grade Roster.&nbsp; After posting, the new grade will 
be included in the calculation of the student's GPA.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:black">If the incomplete grade is not removed by the 
instructor within one year (the last day of finals one year later), the <b>I</b> 
grade will convert to a failing grade. For undergraduate courses, the one-year 
limit may be extended for one additional year if, prior to converting to an E, 
the extension is approved by the instructor and the dean of the college in which 
the student is registered. For graduate courses, the one-year extension must be 
approved by the instructor and Graduate College dean.&nbsp; This extension requires the instructor and dean's 
signature on a Petition for Extension of Course Work.&nbsp; Notification of the 
dean's approval or denial is to be provided to the student by the dean's 
office.&nbsp; A copy of the approved or denied Petition must then be forwarded from 
the dean's office to the Office of the Registrar, Administration 210, for 
appropriate processing.&nbsp; Once the <b>I</b><i> </i>has converted to an <b>E</b>, 
a one-year extension will only be considered for an undergraduate course if the student submits an appeal to 
the University General Petition Committee.&nbsp; Additionally, a request for an 
extension of time beyond 2 academic years of the original course enrollment 
requires approval by the General Petition Committee.&nbsp; For courses taken for 
graduate credit, an extension beyond 2 academic years may be considered only by the Graduate College.</span></p>

<p>In the case of complete <a href="leavingu.htm">Withdrawal from the
  University</a>, if a student withdraws before the end of the second week of 
classes in a regular semester (before the end of the fourth week for graduate 
and&nbsp; professional students), no classes show on the student's permanent 
record.&nbsp; If a student withdraws from the University after the second week of classes 
during a regular semester (after the fourth week for graduate and professional 
students) and before the final exam period, the
  grade of WC (withdrawal-complete) is awarded for all classes processed in the 
complete withdrawal.&nbsp; WC grades are NOT
included in the GPA and are not included in the 18-unit W maximum. The refund schedule is listed for each term in the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">

  <p><b>O&nbsp; <a name="O">Audit</a> Grade:</b></p>
<p>The grade of O is awarded for courses taken for
  audit.&nbsp; Audit grades are not
  awarded unless the student is registered for audit.&nbsp; (In the case of COOP
  100, students are automatically registered for audit.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Audit grades are
NOT included in the GPA.&nbsp; See the <a href="audit.htm">audit
        policy</a> for details and the use of WO and XO grades.</p>
  <p><b>CR&nbsp; <a name="Credit">Credit</a>:</b></p>
<p>The grade of CR is a passing grade

Credit</a>.&nbsp; Failing grades are not recorded.&nbsp; The CR grade is NOT included in the
GPA.</p>

<p>CR grade for 930 <a href="house.htm#900">house
