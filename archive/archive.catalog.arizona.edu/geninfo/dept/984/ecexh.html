<h2 align="center"><small>ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING (ECE) </small></h2>

<p>The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering and
Mines offers the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, in Computer
Engineering, and in Optical Engineering, and Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy
with a major in electrical engineering. </p>

<p>All three of the undergraduate curricula have the goal of educating immediately
productive engineers who are also qualified to pursue further education as necessary to
keep pace with these rapidly changing areas. The electrical engineering program prepares
students for careers in such areas as electronics, microelectronics, communications,
controls, electromagnetics, and signal processing. The computer engineering program
prepares students for computer-related careers including microcomputer-based design,
computer-aided VLSI design, computer networks, and artificial intelligence applications.
The optical engineering program, offered in cooperation with the Optical Sciences Center,
supports careers in areas involving optical design, optical fabrication and testing,
lasers, optical detectors, optical instrumentation, optical fiber communications, etc. </p>

<p>The department participates in the honors program.</p>

<h3><a name="deg">BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER ENGINEERING</a></h3>

<h3>(ABET Accredited)</h3>

<p>The computer engineering program prepares students to work in the dynamic and rapidly
expanding field of digital technology. Computer engineers design computers and computer
systems, apply computers as components of larger systems, and apply digital techniques to
solving a broad range of engineering problems. The curriculum includes a strong electrical
engineering component, consisting of most of the required courses in the electrical
engineering curriculum. To this base it adds extensive course work in both the hardware
and software aspects of computers and digital systems. The program is strengthened by the
availability of extensive laboratory and computing facilities.<br>
<br>
The presence in the department of the Computer Engineering Research Laboratory, the
Computer-Aided Design Laboratory, the Digital Image Analysis Laboratory, and the
Computer-Aided Engineering Center, as well as research in artificial intelligence and
expert systems, computer communications, computer networking, simulation, and other
specialties, maintains a modern viewpoint in the undergraduate curriculum.<font size="3"><br>

<p>The goal of the electrical engineering undergraduate curriculum is to educate
immediately productive electrical engineers who are also qualified to pursue further
educational activities. The program emphasizes basic scientific knowledge, modern design
techniques,<br>
and laboratory techniques needed for design verification.</a> </p>

<h3><a name="deg">BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN OPTICAL ENGINEERING</a></h3>
<a name="deg"><font size="3">

<p>The undergraduate optical engineering program is designed to educate optical engineers
who will be productive immediately upon graduation in areas involving optical design,
optical fabrication and testing, lasers, optical detectors, optical instrumentation,
optical fiber communications. This program, which is an interdisciplinary program offered
by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Optical Sciences Center,
has a strong electrical engineeringcomponent. The curriculum includes many of the courses
required for the B.S. degree in electrical engineering, and qualified graduates should
have little difficulty pursuing further educational opportunities at the graduate level if
desired.</font></a> </p>
