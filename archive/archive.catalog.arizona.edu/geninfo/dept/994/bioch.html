<p>Biochemistry provides the fundamentals for study of the molecular principles in

biology, medicine, and the health sciences and agricultural sciences. Teaching and

research in biochemistry are carried out in several locations in the University, with the

main administrative offices and most professors located in Biosciences West.

&nbsp; Biochemistry is responsible for instruction in biochemistry in the College of Arts

and Science and the Collage of Medicine. These programs serve as an excellent background

for graduate study in biochemistry or the many health-related sciences, including a major

preprofessional program for qualification for professional schools of medicine, dentistry

and osteopathy. </p>



<p>The University Department of Biochemistry offers the Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of

Science in Agriculture, Bachelor of Arts, Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy

degrees with a major in biochemistry. Applicants are not admitted directly to the Master

of Science program. The degree is awarded only in rare instances when individuals admitted

to Ph.D. programs terminate early.</p>
