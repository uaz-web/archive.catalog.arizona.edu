<h2 align="left"><small><small>HYDROLOGY AND WATER RESOURCES <b>(HWR )</b> </small></small></h2>



<p>Hydrology and water resources include the origin, distribution, and properties of the

waters of the Earth, as well as the development and management of water resource systems

for multiple purposes. The faculty offers competence in hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry,

environmental hydrology, ground-water and surface-water hydrology, hydrometeorology,

hydroclimatology, water quality, mathematical and statistical methods in hydrology

(including numerical modeling), and water resources engineering, planning, management and

administration. </p>



<p>The department offers the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Hydrology and Water

Resources and the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees with a major in

hydrology. The undergraduate major in hydrology assumes substantial knowledge of

mathematics. For information regarding graduate degrees, please see the <a href="http://grad.arizona.edu"><i>Graduate Catalog</i></a>. </p>



<p>The department participates in the honors program. Honors students complete an approved

senior honors thesis in lieu of the senior capstone course. </p>



<h3><small>BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN HYDROLOGY </small></h3>



<p><font size="3">Water is life: it is an essential component of our environment.

Hydrology, the science of water, deals with the origin, distribution, and properties -

physical, chemical and biological - of waters of the Earth and even other planets, such as

Mars. Environmental Hydrology is the applied science that investigates and characterizes

the environmental state of our water and related land and ecological resources.

Hydrologists work with water resource problems related to pollution, its prevention and

clean-up, and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, and water management concerns,

including water supply, the design of wells and reservoirs, recreation, and environmental

impacts on water quality. Protecting the quality of water for all uses is a critical part

of the mission of hydrologists. </font></p>



<p><font size="3">The hydrology curriculum is designed to give the student a basic

knowledge of hydrology and allied subjects, including the basic environmental sciences,

hydrologic modeling, and computer applications. Flexibility is offered through the

selection of general education courses (Tier 1 and Tier 2), core electives, technical

electives, and specialty options. The faculty offer expertise in the areas of

hydrometeorology, hydrogeology, environmental chemistry, environmental hydrology, water

resources engineering, water resources engineering-systems, and water resources

engineering-policy. Instruction is augmented at all levels with field trips in Arizona, a

state with great diversity of topographic and geologic features and climate zones, making

it a superb outdoor laboratory. The field course and a senior capstone course provide

direct experience with hydrologic measurements, testing, and data gathering. Students

apply these techniques at field sites and in research laboratories and process the

resulting measurement data using computer models. </font></p>



<p><font size="3">The field and internship experiences, coupled with a curriculum

encompassing environmental hydrology and water resources in depth, enable graduates with a

Bachelor of Science in Environmental Hydrology and Water Resources to obtain entry-level

professional positions and to perform the duties of these positions in a manner that leads

to rapid career advancement.</font>
