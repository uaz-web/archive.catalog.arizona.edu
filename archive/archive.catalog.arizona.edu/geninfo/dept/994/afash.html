<h2 align="left"><small>COMMITTEE ON </small><small>AFRICANA STUDIES (AFAS)</small></h2>
<p><font size="3">The objectives of the Africana Studies Program are to provide
students with opportunities to learn about the African heritage in the Americas.
Its curriculum is designed 1) to explore past and present cultural, political,
and economic links between Africa and African descent populations in the
Americas, and 2) to provide a comparative interdisciplinary theoretical and
methodological examination of issues shaping the lives of persons of African
descent in the United States and other nations of the Americas. The program
seeks to accomplish these goals by 1) identifying courses offered in other
departments and programs which focus on Africa or populations of African descent
in the Americas, and 2) providing a minor in African American Studies which
provides different perspectives from which to examine issues to which students
are exposed. Africana Studies courses are intended to supplement disciplinary
offering as well as provide students with perspectives from within and across
disciplines which challenge and question their established theories, methods,
and conclusions.</font>
