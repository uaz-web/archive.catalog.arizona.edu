<h3 align="left"><font size="4"><b>INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAM IN LATIN AMERICAN
STUDIES (LA S)</b></font></h3>
<p>The Latin American Area Center offers an interdisciplinary program covering
all aspects of Latin American society and culture. A student interested in the
Latin American area selects a concentration in one department (anthropology, art
history, geography and regional development, history, political science,
Portuguese, or Spanish) and enriches that concentration with related studies,
cultural or professional, in other departments. Students are encouraged to spend
at least one summer studying abroad at one of the University-sponsored schools
and/or enroll in a LAS-approved internship. Study abroad opportunities are
available at the Guadalajara Summer School, the summer and semester program in
Brazil through the Universidad Federal de Cerara in Fortaleza, and the semester
program in Mexico at the Instituto Technologico y de Estudios Superiores de
Monterrey (ITESM) and the Universidad de Guanajuato. Summer or semester study is
also available through the Arizona-Sonora University student exchange program.
Although there are no prerequisites, students planning to major in the field are
strongly advised to take some of the introductory and survey courses related to
Latin America at the lower-division level.</p>
<h4 align="left">CAREER ORIENTATIONS</h4>
<p>The program is designed primarily for students planning government, business,
teaching, or other careers. The center places a high priority on providing job
placement for its majors and works with students to arrange internship and study
abroad programs. Furthermore, the center has developed a network of information
and contacts which covers such areas as the Peace Corps, the military,
government and non-profit agencies, journalisam, teaching, and international
business and finance.
