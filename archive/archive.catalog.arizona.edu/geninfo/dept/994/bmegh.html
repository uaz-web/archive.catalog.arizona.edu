ENGINEERING (BME )</small></small></h2>
<p align="left">Biomedical engineering is a discipline which integrates the
engineering sciences with biology and medicine. The field of biomedical
engineering has seen a dramatic escalation in activity over the past 20 years
leading to the development of a wide variety of medical devices, medical
procedures and a basic understanding of biological processes. Engineering
approaches are becoming increasingly important in modern biological and medical
research and in the development of new technologies that stem from recent
discoveries. The University of Arizona has established strengths in medical and
biological engineering with faculty members providing education and research
opportunities from nearly every scientific discipline on the campus.</p>
<p>No undergraduate biomedical engineering degrees are offered. The University
Committee on Biomedical Engineering coordinates options available to
undergraduate students in several colleges at the university. The program
educates undergraduates in the field of biomedical engineering through courses,
senior design projects and investigator sponsored research projects.</p>
<p>For more information about graduate admission criteria and available programs
contact the program offices.
