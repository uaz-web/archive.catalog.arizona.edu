<h2 align="center">NURSING</h2>

<h3><a name="intro"><b>Introduction</b></a> </h3>

<p>The College of Nursing offers a professional program leading to the Bachelor of Science
in Nursing degree (B.S.N.) and graduate programs leading to the Master of Science and
Doctor of Philosophy degrees with a major in nursing. The B.S.N. and graduate curriculum
are currently under review. Prospective students should consult the College of Nursing for
current information. For information regarding graduate study, please see the Graduate
Catalog. </p>

<p>The College of Nursing also offers a B.S.N. pathway for registered nurses who graduated
from associate degree or diploma nursing programs and an accelerated B.S.N. pathway for
superior students who are college graduates holding a baccalaureate or higher degree in a
non-nursing field. </p>

<p>The program which leads to the B.S.N. degree prepares the graduate to begin practice as
a professional nurse, and to undertake graduate study in nursing. The curriculum is
composed of prenursing courses, which are taken in Arts and Sciences, followed by the
professional nursing major. After having completed the pre-nursing phase of the program,
students are admitted selectively to the College of Nursing to begin the nursing major in
fall or spring. A minimum of 30 units of the nursing major must be University Credit
course work. Minor programs of study are available for undergraduates. Completion of a
minor is not required for graduation from the College of Nursing. A minimum of 18 units of
course work must be completed with a grade point average of 2.00 or better to successfully
complete a minor. A minimum of 12 units must be upper-division course work. Selection of a
minor should be made in consultation with a College of Nursing advisor. </p>

<p>Nursing students are preparing for a profession which is exacting and in which they
must take responsibility for the lives and well-being of others. Applicants must be in
good physical and mental health; otherwise, they may be denied admission or, once
admitted, recommended for withdrawal. </p>

<p>The college is accredited by the National League for Nursing and approved by the
Arizona State Board of Nursing. Upon recommendation of the faculty, the graduates will be
admitted to the licensing examination administered by the State Board of Nursing. </p>

<h3><a name="req">REQUIREMENTS</a> </h3>

<p>Any entering freshman who meets University admission requirements may be admitted to
the Arts and Sciences for the pre-nursing portion of the program. </p>

<p>Transfer students must meet the same University admission requirements. They may
complete all freshman and sophomore general education requirements as listed in the
nursing program at another college or university, or may present a combination of transfer
and University of Arizona courses for consideration for admission to the nursing major.
Before a decision to transfer to The University of Arizona is made, prospective transfer
students are strongly advised to have their previous course work evaluated by the College
of Nursing. </p>

<p>There is a selection process before any student can be accepted into the College of
Nursing for the professional nursing courses. To be considered for admission to the
baccalaureate program, a student must have: removed any high school deficiencies;
completed designated prerequisites; earned a 2.750 grade-point average in designated
prerequisites; and earned a cumulative grade-point average of 2.750. </p>

<p>Completion of prerequisite courses with a 2.750 average does not assure a student of
admission to the professional nursing courses. The number of applicants admitted to the
professional courses is limited by the resources of the college. A grade-point average
above 3.00 is normally required. </p>

<p>All transfer students must have a minimum 2.750 average on all freshman and sophomore
courses for both University of Arizona and transfer credits for consideration for
admission to the college. Students who have done well at other nursing schools may be
permitted to transfer to The University of Arizona. A letter from the dean or director of
the nursing school stating that the applicant is in good standing and eligible to continue
nursing studies at that institution is required. Admission criteria for the College of
Nursing are periodically reviewed. Consult with the College of Nursing for current
information. </p>

<p>Students are required to take the University of Arizona Writing-Proficiency Examination
before starting their classes in the College of Nursing. Students who have an
unsatisfactory rating on the examination will be required to complete developmental work
acceptable to the College of Nursing. </p>

<p>All students entering the College of Nursing are required to have basic computer
knowledge, obtained in high school, computer store, university courses, or self-taught. </p>

<p>Since enrollment in the college is limited, completion of freshman courses by entering
freshmen or transfer students with the required grade-point average does not assure the
student of admission to the major. Once admitted to the major, the student must be full
time, attending five consecutive semesters. During these semesters the student must be
enrolled for all required courses. </p>

<p>Students seeking acceptance to the College of Nursing for a fall semester need to file
the special application form, obtained directly from the college, by December 1 of the
previous year in which they desire to enter and can expect to hear of their status in
early April. Students planning to enter the college in a spring semester must file this
application by July 1 of the previous year and can expect a response regarding acceptance
in early October. The College of Nursing does not maintain a waiting list. Students
wishing to reapply must contact the College of Nursing regarding reapplication. </p>

<p>In addition to these requirements, registered nurses from diploma or associate degree
schools of nursing must hold a current, valid Arizona license to practice nursing. For
these applicants, acceptance of transfer credits and the establishment of credit by
examination will be considered on an individual basis. </p>

<p>Since clinical laboratories are in a variety of community settings, all students in the
clinical nursing courses are required to provide their own transportation to the areas
where they are assigned for patient-care experience. </p>

<p>A candidate for the degree of B.S.N. must fulfill the requirements both in number and
kind of units as outlined in the catalog under which the student has chosen to graduate.
The graduation average must be 2.000 or better, with an average of 2.000 or better for all
work undertaken in the major field at The University of Arizona </p>

<p>Graduation from the College of Nursing is not the sole criterion for obtaining a
license to practice nursing in Arizona. Licensing requirements are the exclusive
responsibility of the State Board of Nursing. Graduates must satisfy licensure
requirements independently of degree requirements. </p>

<h3>Grading Policy for Nursing Courses </h3>

<p>The grade of &quot;D&quot; is unacceptable for courses in the nursing major, including
pre-nursing courses, as it does not reflect acceptable performance. Pre-nursing students
who do not complete a required course(s) with a grade &quot;C&quot; or better must repeat
the course. Students already enrolled in the College of Nursing who do not complete a
required course(s) with a grade &quot;C&quot; or better, are not eligible to progress in
the professional nursing major. The student may be permitted to repeat the course for
credit. </p>

<h3>HONORS </h3>

<p>The college participates in the Honors Program. </p>

<h3>Admission to the Baccalaureate Program </h3>

<p>Any entering freshman who meets university admission requirements may be admitted to
University College for the pre-nursing portion of the program. Transfer students must meet
the same university admission requirements. In addition to these requirements, registered
nurses from diploma or associate degree schools of nursing must hold a current, valid
Arizona license to practice nursing. All students entering the College of Nursing are
required to have basic computer knowledge, obtained in high school, computer store,
university courses, or self-taught. Applicants must also be in good physical and mental
health; otherwise, they may be denied admission or, once admitted, recommended for
withdrawal.<br>
</p>

<p>Admission to the pre-nursing phase of the program does not guarantee admission to the
professional phase. Admission to the professional program is competitive. Contact the
college at the address above for information about selection criteria and the admissions
process. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Undergraduate Program </h3>

<p>The program which leads to the B.S.N. is composed of pre-nursing courses and general
education courses, which are taken in University College, followed by the professional
nursing major. After having completed the pre-nursing phase of the program, students are
admitted selectively to the College of Nursing to begin the nursing major in fall or
spring.<br>
</p>

<p>Once admitted to the major, the student must be full time, attending five consecutive
semesters. During these semesters the student must be enrolled for all required courses. </p>
