<h3>Undergraduate Admission</h3>

<p>The College of Education is an upper-division college, providing undergraduates with
course work at the junior and senior level only. Undergraduates normally apply for
admission to the college at the end of their sophomore year, after two years at a two- or
four-year institution as pre-education majors. If enrolled at The University of Arizona,
pre-education majors are administratively housed in University College. All students
seeking admission to the College of Education are strongly encouraged to consult an
academic advisor in the Office of Student and Career Services (621-7865) in the College of
Education early in their college career.</p>

<h3>General Education Program </h3>

<p>All undergraduate students are required to complete a common general education program.
Designed to provide a foundation for university learning, the program develops
students&#146; creative and analytical skills and integrates knowledge across university
disciplines.</p>

<p>Pre-education majors generally complete their general education course work in the
freshman and sophomore years. Students and advisors should consult the <b><i>On Course!</i></b>
Academic Program Requirements Reports (APRRs) for specific general education and major
requirements.
