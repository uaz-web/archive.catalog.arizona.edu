<h3><a name="llm">LL.M. PROGRAM</a> </h3>

<p>The University of Arizona College of Law is now offering a program leading to the
degree of master of laws in international trade law. The LL.M. program, approved by the
American Bar Association and the Arizona Board of Regents, enrolled its first ten students
- law graduates from the United States, Mexico, Spain and Germany - in August 1994. </p>

<p>The one-year, full-time program, offered in coordination with the National Law Center
for Inter-American Free Trade, is designed to provide candidates with the theoretical and
practical knowledge required to understand current developments in the areas of
international trade and commercial law, particularly with regard to Western Hemisphere
free trade and economic integration. LL.M. candidates will complete a minimum of 24 credit
hours for the degree. The curriculum includes &quot;core&quot; courses such as
international trade and investment law, international commercial law and international
litigation, as well as related general courses such as corporate law, securities law,
administrative law, antitrust law and the Uniform Commercial Code. </p>

<p>All LL.M. candidates must be J.D. graduates of an ABA approved law school in the United
States, or demonstrate equivalent academic credentials from an accredited foreign law
school. Candidates should have a strong academic record, experience or interest in
international law, and fluency in English as well as Spanish or Portuguese. </p>
