<h2 align="center">College Information</h2>
<h3 align="left">ARIZONA INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE</h3>
<p>In summer 1998, Arizona International College (AIC) moved to a new location
on The University of Arizona main campus. The new location provides AIC students
with easy access to the educational resources and student services available at
UA Main Campus. AIC is expected to remain on the UA Main campus for three to
five years while the college further develops its programs, policies, and
curriculum in anticipation of becoming independent.</p>
<p><b>Admissions Requirements</b></p>
<p>Students must apply to the University for admission. Entering freshmen must
meet the <img src="../../../images/images1999/unofficial-sm.gif" width="15" height="16">
<a href="https://admissions.arizona.edu/freshmen/admissions-requirements">Admissions
entrance requirements</a> established by the Arizona Board of Regents for all
Arizona universities.</p>
<p><b>Transfer Policies</b></p>
<p>UA students wishing to transfer to AIC from another college at the university
should first consult with an AIC advisor. A student's UA course work will be
evaluated for its applicability to AIC graduation requirements. Students who
complete all UA general education requirements will satisfy AIC's core
requirements. Transfer students who have not completed their UA general
education program may still use their UA courses to meet many AIC core
requirements; in such cases the applicability of transfer course work will be
determined on a course by course basis.</p>
<p>Contact AIC Admissions and Enrollment at (520) 626-0624 to schedule an
appointment for pre-transfer advising.</p>
<h2><small><small>Curriculum</small></small></h2>
<p>The curriculum at Arizona International College is unique among UA colleges.
AIC's curriculum design presupposes a close professional and personal
relationship between students and faculty members, based on a contract approach
to teaching and learning. After completing a common core program, students work
with faculty advisors to design an individual course of study in one of six
areas of concentration. Students also satisfy competency requirements in six
essential skills, and complete two supervised internships in service learning
and career preparation. AIC awards the Bachelor of Arts degree with a
concentration in one of the six major content areas of study.</p>
<p>AIC students will generally take AIC courses to satisfy degree requirements.
AIC students may enroll in courses offered by another UA college if these
courses are first approved by both advisor and student as part of the student's
learning contract. UA Main Campus students may enroll in an AIC course only with
the instructor's and their major advisor's permission. Main campus students may
add AIC courses only during the drop/add period at the beginning of the
semester.</p>
<h3><small>Core Curriculum</small></h3>
<font size="2">
<p></font><font size="3">All students begin the core program with an
introductory course, On Becoming a Fully Educated Person. During their first two
semesters, AIC students also complete other specified core courses Critical
Writing and Communication, Introduction to Global Perspectives, Statistical
Techniques for Problems of the Modern World, Human Consciousness and the
Formation of World Views, and First Year Symposium. The core program </font>also
requires second language study, along with the exploration of the culture and
political economy of the second language region.<font size="2"></p>
</font>
<h3><small>Concentrations</small></h3>
<p>AIC does not offer traditional majors. Instead, the college classifies
academic programs in six broadly construed areas of advanced study called
concentrations. Within the area of study defined by a concentration, a student
works closely with a faculty advisor to develop a unique program of study tied
to specific academic and career goals. The six concentrations are described
below.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4>Natural Sciences and Mathematics</h4>
  <p>Natural Sciences and Mathematics combines rigorous study of fundamentals in
  biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics with a broad view of how
  scientific knowledge relates to our society. Popular areas of interest include
  pre-medicine and environmental science.</p>
  <h4>Social Sciences</h4>
  <p>Social Sciences introduces students to disciplines such as psychology,
  sociology, economics, and political science. Using the perspectives offered by
  scholarship in these areas, students develop the skills to analyze
  contemporary issues like citizenship, poverty, diversity, and social conflict
  at local, national, and global levels. Many pre-law and business students
  follow social science programs.</p>
  <h4>Humanities</h4>
  <p>Humanities students grapple with the universal questions of who we are and
  what makes us human. Students explore disciplines such as history, philosophy,
  literature, and religious studies to gain an understanding of our disparate
  cultures, our traditions, and where we are headed.</p>
  <h4>Fine and Performing Arts</h4>
  <p>Students of Fine and Performing Arts learn about traditions and techniques
  in fields such as art, music, theater, dance, and film. Studies in this area
  emphasize both the development of personal creativity and an understanding of
  art as an enduring element of human culture.</p>
  <h4>Language and Culture</h4>
  <p>The concentration in Language and Culture emphasizes proficiency in a
  second language as an essential step toward experiencing and understanding
  another culture. Students combine language studies with other cultural studies
  such as the literature, history, theater, or music of a country or region.
  Study abroad, through course work, internships, or independent study is an
  important component of each student's program.</p>
  <h4>Liberal Studies</h4>
  <p>The Liberal Studies option allows students to develop a concentration that
  spans two or more of the categories above. Examples of such programs are
  sustainable development, women's studies, international trade, international
  relations, and environmental studies. Students may also design new programs to
  match particular academic interests or career goals.</p>
