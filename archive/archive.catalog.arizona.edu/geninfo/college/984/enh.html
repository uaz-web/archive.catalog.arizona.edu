<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>Engineering education is preparation for a professional career. While most
graduates embark on careers in engineering practice, men and women with
engineering majors find the baccalaureate program excellent preparation for
other fields as diverse as law, medicine, business and government. An
engineering education develops analytical and quantitative thinking, a critical
but optimistic approach to problem solving, and the habit of self-directed
future learning. Graduates make successful transitions to a wide variety of
different careers. The graduate has a thorough understanding of how materials,
energy, and information can be adapted to humanity's needs and desires. This is
developed through the study of physical science, mathematics, engineering
science, engineering design, humanities, social science and practice.</p>
<h3><a name="Admissions">Entrance Requirements</a></h3>
<p><font size="3">In addition to University admission requirements, applicants
are required to present 1/2 unit of trigonometry. It is strongly recommended
that one unit of physics and one unit of chemistry be presented. Students
transferring into the college must have cumulative grade-point averages of 2.500
for all previous college work. Applicants must be ranked in the upper 25 percent
of the high school graduating class; or have achieved a grade-point average of
3.0 on a 4.0 scale; or a composite score of 23 (24 for out-of-state applicants)
on the ACT; or a minimum combined score of 1050 on the SAT.</font></p>
<h3><a name="Advanced Standing">Advanced Standing</a></h3>
<p><font size="3">Student must have been granted advanced standing to enroll in
300- or 400-level courses in the College of Engineering and Mines. The criteria
for achieving advanced standing are available in Room 200 of the Engineering
Bldg., in departmental offices, or on-line at <i><a href="http://www.engr.arizona.edu/">http://www.engr.arizona.
edu/</a> .</i></font></p>
<h3><a name="General_Education_Program">General Education Program</a></h3>
<p><font size="3">All undergraduate students are required to complete a general
education program. Designed to provide a foundation for university learning, the
program develops students’ creative and analytical skills and integrates
knowledge across university disciplines. General education requirements for
engineering students are available in the APRR associated with each degree
program at <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">http://www.arizona.edu/academic/oncourse/data/interface/EN.html</a>
, in Engineering 200, in departmental offices, or on line at <i><a href="http://www.engr.arizona.edu/">http://www.engr.arizona.edu/</a>
.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Because of the prerequisite content of engineering curricula,
for advising purposes degree requirements are presented in a
semester-by-semester program that can be completed in 4 years. Four-year plans
for the undergraduate degrees listed above are available in Engineering 200, in
departmental offices, or on line at <a href="http://www.engr.arizona.edu/~acadaff/"><i>http://www.engr.arizona.edu/</i>.</a></font></p>
<p><font size="3">For academic requirements for graduate degrees consult the <i>Graduate
Catalog</i>. </font></p>
<h3>Academic Advising</h3>
<p>Visit your advisor every semester. Academic advisors are assigned by
contacting the departmental offices.</p>
<h3>College of Engineering and Mines Freshman Honors Program</h3>
<p>This program recognizes the abilities and achievements of high school
graduates and offers a variety of special challenges and resources to encourage
the full development of academic and interpersonal skills. The program is open
to freshmen who have applied for admission to the College of Engineering and
Mines and University Honors Program can be obtained from the Honors Program,
Slonaker Building, University of Arizona,Tucson, Arizona 85721. Freshman honors
students are strongly encouraged to register for ENGR 196a and 196b.</p>
<h3>Accreditation and the Curricular Content Required<br>
for Engineering Degrees</h3>
<p>The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is the official
agency for accrediting undergraduate engineering degrees. As part of the
required curricular content, every engineering student must complete a minimum
of 16 units of engineering design and 32 units of engineering science. These
requirements are integrated into the curricula that are specified on the
following pages for each engineering degree. For more information about ABET
requirements, contact the Office of Academic Affairs at 621-6032.</p>
<h4>Engineering Design (ED)</h4>
<p>Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component,or process
to meet desired needs. It is a decision-making process in which resources are
converted optimally to meet stated objectives. ED courses include at least some
of the following features: development of creativity, use of open-ended
problems, development and use of design methodology, formulation of problem
statements and specifications, consideration of alternative solutions,
feasibility considerations, and detailed system descriptions. They may also
include constraints such as economic factors, safety,reliability, aesthetics,
ethics, and social impact.</p>
<h4>Engineering Science (ES)</h4>
<p>The engineering sciences have their roots in mathematics and basic sciences,
but carry knowledge toward creative application. These studies provide a bridge
between the sciences and engineering practice. At least one ES course must be
taken outside of the department of the major.</p>
<h3>Scholarships</h3>
<p>A limited number of scholarships are recommended each year by departments
within the College of Engineering and Mines. Students interested in applying for
these scholarships should contact their departmental offices for information. It
is usually best to do this prior to March 1.</p>
<h3>Student Professional and Honorary Societies</h3>
<p>Contact departmental or view <a href="http://www.engr.arizona.edu/">http://www.engr.arizona.edu/</a>
.</p>
<h3>Minority Engineering Program</h3>
<p>The Minority Engineering Program (MEP) is an academically-based student
support program for ethnic minorities and women. For additional information,
please contact Edmund Tellez, MEP Director, (520) 621-8103, Engineering
Building, Room 200.</p>
<h3>Graduate Study</h3>
<p><font size="3">For information about graduate programs consult the <em>Graduate
Catalog </em>or the college office listed above.</font></p>
<h3>Career Preparation</h3>
<p>It is recommended that all engineering students participate in a career
experience prior to graduation. This experience can be gained by a full-time
cooperative education work experience, a part-time internship in a local
company, part-time or summer career employment, or a research experience ina
faculty member's laboratory. Information is available through the Academic
Affairs Office in Room 200, Engineering Building.</p>
