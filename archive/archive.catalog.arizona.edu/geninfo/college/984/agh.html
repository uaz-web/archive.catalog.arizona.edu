<h3><a name="gen">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>The College of Agriculture provides professional education for a wide range of career
opportunities in agriculture, natural resources, and in family and consumer resources. The
various curricula offer professional preparation for careers in agri-business, government,
public service agencies, retail and service industries, human health institutions, the
food service and processing industry, financial institutions, youth development agencies,
conservation and environmental organizations, farming and ranching, research, extension,
communications and education. A broad education in a professional knowledge area is
combined with foundation courses in the natural and social sciences, communications and
the humanities to develop a well-rounded academic experience. </p>

<p>College responsibilities include instruction, research and extension. The academic
units of the college include ten departments and two schools. The departments are
Agricultural and Resource Economics, Agricultural Education, Agricultural and Biosystems
Engineering, Animal Sciences, Entomology, Nutrition and Food Science, Plant Pathology,
Plant Sciences, Soil and Water Science, and Veterinary Science. The School of Renewable
Natural Resources is organized into four programs: Watershed Resources, Landscape
Resources, Range Resources, and Wildlife and Fisheries Resources. The School of Family and
Consumer Resources is organized into the divisions of Family Studies and Retailing and
Consumer Studies. The college administers the undergraduate program in microbiology under
the curriculum guidance of a multi-disciplinary faculty committee. The college also
participates in the management of the University departments of Biochemistry, and
Molecular and Cellular Biology where several college faculty hold joint appointments. </p>

<h3><a name="cur">General Education Program</a> </h3>

<p>All undergraduate students in the College of Agriculture are required to complete a
common general education program of study. </p>

<p>The purpose of the general education curriculum is to establish an educational
foundation that will assist students in their development as productive and effective
citizens and prepare them to engage in independent and critical thought using creative and
analytical skills. The general education program is also designed to develop in students
an appreciation for and understanding of world cultures, societal and institutional
standards and interrelationships, cultural heritage, institutional and humanistic values,
the natural sciences, and the arts and humanities. </p>

<p>All undergraduates must complete the Writing-Proficiency Examination administered by
the University Composition Board and earn a grade-point average of at least a 2.000 on all
work undertaken in the major field of study. </p>

<p>Students are strongly encouraged to have their own microcomputer. To be compatible with
College of Agriculture Computer laboratories, students should have a Windows-based, 486 or
higher speed processor, with word processing, spreadsheet and communications software. </p>
