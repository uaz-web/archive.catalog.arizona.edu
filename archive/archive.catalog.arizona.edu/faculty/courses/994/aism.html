<p><b>AISM
100. Mathematics in Life, Society and the World </b>(3) I This course is an
introductory survey of a variety of topics such as the history of mathematics and
mathematics in art, music, and nature. Basic mathematical concepts such as critical
thinking, logic, algebra, voting systems, population growth and radioactive decay, social
choice and problem solving are developed and applied to everyday issues. P, consent of
instructor for non-AIC students. </p>

<p><b>AISM
120. College Algebra </b>(3) I II This course for non-mathematics majors and minors
covers the basic concepts of algebra, including linear equations and inequalities,
relations and functions, quadratic equations, and systems of equations. P, two entrance
units in algebra or an acceptable score on the math readiness test. Consent of instructor
for non-AIC students. </p>

<p><b>AISM
121. Introduction to Cellular and Molecular Biology </b>(4) I Explores chemistry of
biological molecules, the molecular workings of cells, and a biochemical look at diseases
such as the common cold, AIDS, and depression. The interaction between science and society
will be discussed, including topics such as genetic engineering and medical ethics. Weekly
labs with investigative exercises with DNA, enzymes, and other biological molecules. P,
AISM 101 or equivalent. Consent of instructor for non-AIC students. </p>

<p><b>AISM
122. Biology of Organisms and the Environment </b>(4) II Building on the foundations
of knowledge and skills from AISM121, this course explores the functioning of plants and
animals and how they adapt to and interact with their environment. Topics include
physiology, genetics, development and reproduction, and ecology. The central organizing
principle of the course is evolution as a way of understanding individual organisms and
the diversity of life on earth. The course will include consideration of contemporary
social issues such as health care and environmental ethics. Field Trips. P, AISM 121 or
equivalent. Consent of instructor for non-AIC students. </p>

<p><b>AISM
131A. Principles of Chemistry </b>(4) I The first of a two-semester sequence covering
essential concepts and methods in chemistry, including bonds, the relationship between
structure and properties, stoichiometry, kinetics, and equilibria. Class discussions will
include environmental and ethical issues such as the Bhopal explosion and water use in the
west and southwest. Weekly labs will include investigative exercises applying principles
learned in class and development of skills, including technical writing. P, AISM 101 or
equivalent. Consent of instructor for non-AIC students. </p>

<p><b>AISM
135A. Calculus I </b>(3) I Introduction to calculus with emphasis on understanding and
problem solving. Concepts are presented graphically as well as algebraically. Elementary
functions, their properties and uses in modeling; the key concepts of derivative and
definite integral; techniques of differentiation, using the derivative to understand the
behavior of functions; applications to optimization problems in physics, biology, and
economics. P, pre-calculus or consent of instructor. Consent of instructor for non-AIC
students. </p>

<p><b>AISM
135B. Calculus II </b>(3) I II Techniques of symbolic and numerical integration,
applications of the definite integral to geometry, physics, economics and probability;
differential equations from a numerical, graphical, and algebraic point of view; modeling
using differential equations; approximations by Taylor series. P, pre-calculus or consent
of instructor. Consent of instructor for non-AIC students. </p>

<p><b>AISM
199. Independent Study </b>(1-4) [Rpt./] I II P, consent of instructor for non-AIC
students. </p>

<p><b>AISM
220. Molecular Genetics in a Social Context: Darwin to Dolly </b>(3) II This course is
intended to provide 200-level students with an integrated understanding of the genetics,
biochemistry, molecular genetics and molecular biology that form the basis of the
biological revolution caused by genetic engineering. P, consent of instructor for non-AIC
students. </p>
