  </b><h2><b>Arizona International College</b></h2>
  <h3>Natural Science and Mathematics (AISM)</h3>
  <p><b><a name="AISM101" >101.</a>
  Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Analysis </b>(3) I II Designed to introduce first year
  students to interdisciplinary thinking through the concepts, methods, and approaches of
  more than one field in the natural sciences. Topics may vary each year but will always
  address the applicability of scientific principles to contemporary issues that face
  citizens in the local and global communities. P, consult AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM121" >121.</a>
  Introduction to Cellular and Molecular Biology </b>(4) I Explores chemistry of biological
  molecules, the molecular workings of cells, and a biochemical look at diseases such as the
  common cold, AIDS, and depression. The interaction between science and society will be
  discussed, including topics such as genetic engineering and medical ethics. Weekly labs
  with investigative exercises with DNA, enzymes, and other biological molecules. P, AISM
  101 or equivalent. Consult AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM122" >122.</a>
  Biology of Organisms and the Environment </b>(4) I II Building on the foundations of
  knowledge and skills from AISM121, this course explores the functioning of plants and
  animals and how they adapt to and interact with their environment. Topics include
  physiology, genetics, development and reproduction, and ecology. The central organizing
  principle of the course is evaluation, as a way of understanding individual organisms and
  the diversity of life on earth. The course will include consideration of contemporary
  social issues such as health care and environmental ethics. Field trip. P, AISM 121 or
  equivalent. Consult AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM131A" >131A.</a>
  Principles of Chemistry </b>(4) I The first of a two-semester sequence covering essential
  concepts and methods in chemistry, including bonds, the relationship between structure and
  properties, stoichiometry, kinetics, and equilibria. Class discussions will include
  environmental and ethical issues such as the Bhopal explosion and water use in the west
  and southwest. Weekly labs will include investigative exercises applying principles
  learned in class and development of skills, including technical writing. P, AISM 101 or
  equivalent. Consult AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM131B" >131B.</a>
  Principles of Chemistry </b>(4) I The second of a two-semester sequence covering essential
  concepts and methods in chemistry, including bonds, the relationship between structure and
  properties, stiochiometry, kinetics, and equilibria. Class discussions will include
  environmental and ethical issues such as the Bhopal explosion and water use in the west
  and southwest. Weekly labs will include investigative exercises applying principles
  learned in class and development of skills, including technical writing. P, consult AIC
  instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM135A" >135A.</a>
  Calculus I </b>(3) I Introduction to calculus with emphasis on understanding and problem
  solving. Concepts are presented graphically as well as algebraically. Elementary
  functions, their properties and uses in modeling; the key concepts of derivative and
  definite integral; techniques of differentiation, using the derivative to understand the
  behavior of functions; applications to optimization problems in physics, biology, and
  economics. P, pre-calculus or consent of instructor. Consult AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM135B" >135B.</a>
  Calculus II </b>(3) II Techniques of symbolic and numerical integration, applications of
  the definite integral to geometry, physics, economics and probability; differential
  equations from a numerical, graphical, and algebraic point of view; modeling using
  differential equations, approximations by Taylor series. P, pre-calculus or consent of
  instructor. Consult AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM190" >190.</a>
  Applied Introduction to Statistics </b>(3) I II Students in this class will learn the
  basic techniques of descriptive statistics and statistical inference. The applications
  will center on themes that are developed within the first year cluster. P, consult AIC
  instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM199" >199.</a>
  Independent Study </b>(1-4) P, consult AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM220" >220.</a>
  Molecular Genetics in a Social Context: Darwin to Dolly </b>(3) II This course is intended
  to provide 200-level students with an integrated understanding of the genetics,
  biochemistry, molecular genetics and molecular biology that form the basis of the
  biological revolution caused by genetic engineering. P, consult AIC instructor. </p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM290A" >290A.</a>
  Special Topics: College Algebra </b>(3) II This course is not applicable for mathematics
  majors or minors. It deals with basic concepts of algebra, linear equations and
  inequalities, relations and functions, quadratic equations, and system of equations. P,
  two entrance units in algebra or an acceptable score on the math readiness test. Consult
  AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM299" >299.</a>
  Independent Study </b>(1-3) I II P, consult AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM301" >301.</a>
  Evolutionary Ecology </b>(4) I II An introduction to the principles of ecology from an
  evolutionary perspective. Investigative field exercises are used to illustrate principles
  and teach problem-solving by application of experimental design, data collecting, and
  quantitative analysis of results by basic statistical tools (chi square, t test, linear
  regression, correlation). P, consult AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM399" >399.</a>
  Independent Study </b>(1-3) I II P, consult AIC instructor.</p>
  <p><b><a name="AISM499" >499.</a>
