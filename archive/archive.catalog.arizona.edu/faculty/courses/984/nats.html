  <p><b>NATURAL SCIENCE (NATS)</b></p>
  <p><b><a name="NATS101" >101.</a> The Earth and Its
  Environments </b>(3) I II An overview of the key concepts in physical and chemical
  processes, including Newton's laws governing force and motion, the laws of thermodynamics
  governing energy and entropy, the role of electromagnetism in nature, and the atomic
  structure of matter. The course will explore these concepts in an inter-disciplinary
  context, drawing from areas such as environmental sciences, atmospheric sciences,
  engineering/technological sciences, and others. <dir>
    <b><p>Basic Concepts and Water-Related Applications. </b>This course develops an
    understanding of natural science concepts and ideas and how they can be used to understand
    and analyze processes and objects in the every day world. Water is a central theme.
    Students examine how it is obtained, stored, distributed, used, polluted, and cleaned.
    They learn to estimate its quality, quantity, energy, and movement. It is a broad
    introductory course.</p>
    <b><p>Connections: A Study of Science, Technology and Innovation. </b>Basic aspects of
    physics, chemistry, and astronomy are integrated to show how technology evolves from
    science, interconnecting events, and accidents of time. Who would have imagined that
    modern communications, movies, printing presses, and computers have their roots in the
    stirrup, cannon, 12th century underwear, and the water wheel. We explore the science and
    technology that has given us today's society and examine opportunities for today and the
    future.</p>
    <b><p>Earth's Environment: Introduction to Physical Geography. </b>Introduction to
    fundamental laws of nature as expressed physical processes that govern the spatial
    distribution of Earth's land, sea, air, and biological environments. Focus on fluxes and
    feedbacks among these systems, and interactions with humans.</p>
    <b><p>Earth Resources and the Environment. </b>This is a course about the mineral
    resources of the Earth, our demand and use of these resources for material goods and
    energy, and the environmental consequences of our use of these resources.</p>
    <b><p>A Geological Perspective. </b>Students will learn that a few universal laws describe
    the behavior of our physical surroundings, from the universe to every action in our daily
    lives. this interdisciplinary course will cover aspects of the scientific process,
    astronomy, physics, chemistry, and Earth sciences, with an emphasis on geosciences and
    society, including earthquakes, mass extinctions in geologic history, and global warming.
    It will give students the ability to read and appreciate popular accounts of major
    discoveries and important public issues in the physical sciences.</p>
    <b><p>Introduction to Environmental Science. </b>This course will not be confined to one
    discipline but rather will include information from physics, chemistry, biology and the
    social sciences such as economics and anthropology. The central theme of the course will
    be that of change as a normal and natural process. It will consist of four major focus
    areas: Biodiversity, Pollution, Population, and Resources. Within each major focus area we
    shall explore how change has and is occurring at the local, regional and global scales. To
    facilitate the learning process we shall analyze local, national and international case
    histories. The case histories would include air pollution at the Grand Canyon, TCE
    groundwater contamination in Tucson, landfill and leaking underground storage tanks in
    Tucson, Chernobyl, and the Mt. Graham controversy.</p>
    <b><p>Introduction to Global Change. </b>The basics of physical science are presented
    within the context of global environmental change processes (climatic change, global
    warming, deforestation, etc.) that impact Earth and its inhabitants. Includes hands-on
    activities, discussions, computer exercises, and a personal interest project.</p>
    <b><p>Introduction to Weather and Climate. </b>An introduction to the science of weather
    processes and climate, including the genesis of fronts and cyclones, precipitation
    processes, the wind systems of the world, severe storms, and weather forecasting. Special
    emphasis will be given t natural phenomena which have strong impacts on human activities
    including tornadoes, hurricanes, El Ni�o, global warming, ozone depletion, and air
    pollution. The fundamental importance of physics, chemistry, and mathematics to
    atmospheric science will be stressed.</p>
    <b><p>Science, Technology and Environment. </b>The scientific method, technology, motion,
    energy, gases, heat, chemistry, electricity and magnetism are covered in class lectures.
    In laboratories, students will use physical principles to assess environmental problems
    and technology: e.g., CAP water, air pollution, solar cookers, and water use in the arid
    southwest.</p>
  </dir>
  <p><b>102. Beyond the Earth in Space
  and Time </b>(3) I II Introduction to the study of the planetary and geological
  sciences and their application to events in the everyday world. The course examines
  Newton's laws governing force and motion, the laws of thermodynamics governing energy and
  entropy, the role of electromagnetism in nature, and the atomic structure of matter, in
  the context of current issues in planetary and geological sciences. <dir>
    <dir>
      <b><p>The Concepts of Physical Science. </b>This is a course inquiring into basic concepts
      used by every physical science in its exploration of the world. The concepts originate in
      physics, which offers the framework on which other disciplines are build. Applications of
      the concepts are made in the course, not just to traditional physics problems, but to
      problems in many other scientific disciplines. In the course we will explore the
      development of the concepts from their intuitive beginnings to their present forms. In the
      process, we will see how science searches for a logically consistent explanation of the
      world, and how the creation of these concepts has influenced our perception of that world.</p>
      <b><p>Life in the Universe. </b>The course will emphasize to the student how information
      from different fields of science can be brought together to address a problem and, most
      importantly, how the scientific method can be used to attach problems which at first may
      seem intractable. One major goal of the course will be to impart to the student the
      wonder, uniqueness, and fragility of life on Earth.</p>
      <b><p>The Physical Universe. </b>The Physical Universe presents the astronomical phenomena
      of the universe in the context of physical science.</p>
      <b><p>The Role of Time in Science. </b>The central theme in the course is time; how we
      decide what it is, how we measure it, and how our view of it has changed as we learn more
      about the natural world. The course will discuss many sorts of natural clocks, both cyclic
      (atoms, planet orbits, neutron stars) and non-cyclic growth and decay (chemical and
      nuclear reactions, radioactivity, geological processes, the birth and death of stars), and
      the time scales on which each can be used. We will see how a few central principles keep
      recurring in our attempt to understand the working of these clocks. Ultimately, we will
      discuss how Einstein had to change our ideas about time measurement in order to
      accommodate these principles, and how the accommodation has lead to our present view of
      the universe.</p>
      <b><p>The Universe and Humanity: Origin and Destiny. </b>Formation and evolution of the
      universe, the solar system and life; events which led to our existence; the future for
      life in the solar system; life elsewhere. Designed for non-scientists.</p>
    </dir>
  </dir>
  <p><b>104. Biological Sciences </b>(3)
  I II<b> </b>Introduction to the study of biology and its application to events in the
  everyday world. Areas examined include 1) the evolution and diversity of life, 2) cells,
  3) structure and function or organisms at the multi-cellular level 4) genetics and
  development, 5) health and disease, and 6) interaction and interdependence between
  organisms. <dir>
    <dir>
      <b><p>Biology in Medicine, Engineering and Applied Science. </b>This course will cover the
      fundamental concepts and principles of biology and directly link them to applications in
      medicine, engineering and other applied sciences. A typical class week will consist of two
      one-hour lectures on biological concepts and principles and one three-hour applications
      session. Each applications session will consist of a one-hour seminar on biological
      applications in medicine, engineering and other applied sciences and a two-hour problem
      session.</p>
      <b><p>Evolution of Modern Biology. </b>This course is designed to introduce students to
      concepts in modern biology, with an emphasis on the processes that created the current
      status of life on earth. Students should leave the course with the understanding of the
      relationship between DNA, RNA, proteins, genes the phenotypes. They will be introduced to
      basic metabolism, and the kinds of regulatory networks that control our cells. Students
      also will look at the ways that different types of reproductive strategies are utilized by
      populations of organisms. Finally, we will talk about the ways that humans are changing
      the rules-the impact of recombinant DNA technology on present and future human life.</p>
      <b><p>Nutrition, Food and You. </b>Nutrition, Food and You covers the principles of human
      nutrition. Topics include digestion, absorption, metabolism, vitamins, minerals, life
      cycle nutrition and food safety.</p>
      <b><p>Plants and Our World. </b>Plants and Our World will cover the principles of plant
      growth, development, and reproduction from the cellular to the whole organism levels,
      explore how plants are affected by their environment, and their ecology and evolution. The
      emphasis of the course is on what makes plants uniquely interesting and different from
      other organisms, and their importance to life and society.</p>
