  <b><p>TRADITIONS AND CULTURES (TRAD)</b></p>
  <p><b><a name="TRAD101" >101.</a> Non-Western Cultures and
  Civilizations </b>(3) I Historical development and fundamental concepts of a nonwestern
  culture. Examines how members of a particular culture are shaped by a distinct heritage of
  ideas, values, and artistic expressions that may be in sharp contrast to traditional
  western ideas and values. <dir>
    <b><p>African Diaspora Religion and Culture. </b>This course surveys continental African
    religions and their manifestations in the African Diaspora. Brazil, Jamaica, Trinidad,
    Cuba, Haiti and the U.S.A. are highlighted. The epistemologies and practices of the Fon,
    Yoruba, and Bantu peoples are analyzed to understand their continued impact on the
    contemporary world.</p>
    <p><strong>Asian Humanities: China and Japan.</strong> This course will expose students to
    major artistic, cultural, and literary movements in Japan from pre-history to the present
    day. This course will also emphasize the relationship of literature to traditional arts
    and rituals. Students will discover how poetry, drama, fiction, and film reflect Japanese
    aesthetics, nuances of manners and emotional expressions, and perceptions of nature.
    Religious diversity in Japan will be explored in art and literature, especially Shintoism,
    the Buddhist influences from China, and Zen Buddhism. Cultural transformations in Japan
    will be emphasized, such as aristocratic codes of conduct, samurai codes, rising power of
    chonin (non-samurai urban merchants and artisans), isolation and the West, and
    contemporary material culture. Particular attention will be given to class issues, gender
    categories, and critiques of social institutions and values. </p>
    <b><p>Chinese Civilization. </b>Introduces you to traditional Chinese civilization for the
    purposes of this course defined as: &quot;the totality of a culture's perception of itself
    and the world it occupies and the ways in which that self-perception is expressed in
    society, politics, religion, philosophy, and the arts.&quot; The content of the course is
    arranged in thematic units, each unit being placed in the context of a specific historical
    period. We will examine the religious symbolism of ancient Chinese bronze vessels, Chinese
    theories of nature based on concepts like Yin and Yang, the great medieval religions of
    Taoism and Buddhism, and other topics. Over the semester you will learn to think more like
    the Chinese of centuries past to exercise your imagination, and to explore a world that is
    different from your own.</p>
    <b><p>Colonial Latin America. </b>This course examines 1) the history of Spanish and
    Portuguese exploration, conquest, settlement, and state-building in the Americas; 2) the
    impact of European colonization on indigenous American cultures and civilizations,
    especially the acts of native resistance, accommodation and adaptation that shaped the
    consequences of this cultural encounter; 3) the forced migration of African peoples to the
    Americas, including the development of slave societies, and the emergence of regional
    African-Latin American cultural traditions; and 4) the growth of multiracial social groups
    who developed new and distinctive cultural forms of their own and eventually came to
    challenge the cultural and political hegemony of Spain and Portugal.</p>
    <b><p>Colonialism and Native Peoples. </b>Cultural studies of indigenous groups in the
    Americas, Eurasia, Africa and the Pacific Rim and how these have been shaped by the
    colonial process.</p>
    <p><strong>Confucian Asia.</strong> Although the countries of East Asia and many of those
    in Southeast Asia have very distinct cultures, languages, and national identities today,
    they share one important thing: all have been heavily influenced throughout their history
    by the world view known as Confucianism. This course is designed to examine Confucianism
    in Asia through education, and the importance of ritual and propriety. Beginning at the
    beginning, with the life of Confucius in the 6th century BCE and the principle text that
    bears his name, the Analects, we will explore the central ideas of Confucianism and their
    adoption and adaptation by different Asian societies at different times. We will end with
    a consideration of issues in contemporary Asia and among the Asian-American population in
    the U.S. that demonstrate the continued importance of this way of thought.</p>
    <b><p>The French-Speaking World. </b>This course will consider the development of the
    French-speaking world from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. The first half of the
    course will present a historical perspective on the evolution and exportation of French
    language and culture from 1500 to 1900, while the second half will emphasize the cultural
    and artistic expressions of modern French-speaking countries other than France. </p>
    <p><strong>Introduction to Africana Experience.</strong> This course will introduce
    students to fundamental issues and concepts in the Africana experience in the United
    States, Africa, and the Caribbean, from an interdisciplinary perspective. Principle topics
    of discussion will be drawn from areas of history, philosophy, political-economy,<br>
    literature and the arts, religion-culture and society. </p>
    <p><strong>Languages and Cultures of East Asia.</strong> This course will explore the
    social, historical, and linguistic aspects of the languages and cultures of East Asia and
    how they have changed over time, drawing from anthropology, linguistics, sociology, and
    history.</p>
    <b><p>Many Nations of Native America. </b>An interdisciplinary survey of native peoples in
    North and Central America, from their origins to present. This course is structured around
    the themes of sovereignty, cultural diversity, native epistemologies, the Columbian
    exchange, and cultural transformation and survival. These themes integrate our examination
    of seven native Nations, ranging from the Aztec of Central Mexico to the Inuit of the
    Canadian Arctic. The course focuses on homelands and origins, intercultural exchange,
    demography, ecological transformation, the impacts of introduced epidemic diseases,
    processes of colonialism, social organization and culture, education, and contemporary
    issues.</p>
    <b><p>Middle Eastern Humanities. </b>Introduces students to the values, traditions, and
    development of Middle Eastern (Islamic) culture and civilization. This course is designed
    to familiarize students with the principal achievements in art, architecture and
    literature of Islamic civilization, to help students understand these achievements in
    their social and cultural contexts, and to consider the historical evolution of our
    knowledge and understanding of these achievements.</p>
    <b><p>The Worlds of Buddhism. </b>An introduction to Buddhism as both a religion and an
    array of cultural traditions, with emphasis on its various contributions to the formation
    of the South, Central, Southeast, and East Asian civilizations.</p>
  </dir>
  <p><b><a name="TRAD102" >102.</a> Western Cultures and
  Civilizations: Classical to Renaissance </b>(3) I Historical development and fundamental
  concepts of western civilization, from ancient times to the Renaissance. Examines the
  heritage of ideas, values, and artistic expressions that shaped western tradition during
  that time. <dir>
    <b><p>Books in Dialogue: Classical and Medieval. </b>This course aims to provide solid
    grounding in the Western intellectual and cultural tradition through pairing of central
    literary, philosophical, and theological works. The second work in each pair will be
    studied as a response to the first: e.g., <i>The Aeneid</i> to <i>The Odyssey</i> and
    Aristotle's <i>Ethics</i> to Plato's. Students will be encouraged to deal with each of the
    paired texts individually and comparatively and to compare members of different pairs,
    e.g., Augustine with Plato, and non-scriptural works of the Christian era with the
    selections from the Bible.</p>
    <b><p>Democracy in Theory and Practice: The Greek Experience. </b>Investigation of the
    history and growth of democratic institutions, values and ideas in ancient Greece, with
    some reference to contemporary relevance.</p>
    <b><p>Drama and Dance in Western Cultures: Origins to 1603. </b>Drama and dance are modes
    of creative expression used to communicate ideas, values, stories and myths which help
    define a community or culture. Both art forms employ the human body as the medium through
    which an audience may be engaged. Through ever-changing conventions, drama and dance
    reshape human experience into patterns which help us order our perceptions about the world
    in which we live. This course will focus primarily on principal themes in western culture
    as expressed in drama and dance.</p>
    <b><p>History of Western Civilization: From the Rise of Cities to the Counter Reformation.
    </b>This course explores the civilizations of the West by considering the development of
    the ideas and ideologies that shaped the institutions of the West, development directed by
    Human interaction and conflict on a social, political, religious, and cultural level, in
    addition to the intellectual. Themes of particular interest include the structure and
    dynamics of power, competing configurations of deity and ritual, image and architecture as
    tools in the acquisition of authority, and the construction of a social normative on the
    grounds of class, culture and gender.</p>
    <b><p>Humanities: Ancient Times to Renaissance. </b>Chronological survey of human
    civilizations from pre-history to the renaissance. Students will be introduced to the
    critical analysis of the literacy and artistic expressions that constitute the ideas and
    values of our collective heritage. Emphasis will be placed on the interrelation of Western
    and non-Western cultures and on the inter-perspectives including science, gender and
    psychology, politics, social conditions, religion and philosophy.</p>
    <b><p>In the Beginning: Roots of Western Culture. </b>The roots of &quot;western&quot;
    tradition(s) are often traced to the Classical Greeks. However, by the time that work on
    the Parthenon had begun, the peoples of the Near East and Northeastern Africa had already
    witnessed the rise and fall of a series of great civilizations for over ten thousand
    years. In fact, many of the elements of &quot;classical&quot; civilization can be traced
    to experiments made in this distant past.</p>
    <b><p>Western Culture: The Italian Perspective: Antiquity through the Middle Ages. </b>From
    Antiquity through the Middle Ages. Taught in English.</p>
    <b><p>World History to 1600. </b>Survey of topics in world history to 1600.</p>
  </dir>
  <p><b><a name="TRAD103" >103.</a> Western Cultures and
  Civilizations: Renaissance to Present </b>(3) II Historical development and fundamental
  concepts of western civilization, from the Renaissance to the present. Examines the
  heritage of ideas, values, and artistic expressions that have shaped western tradition
  since the Renaissance. <dir>
    <b><p>The Americas - Renaissance to the Present Day. </b>This course will expose students
    to major movements in the Americas from the Renaissance to contemporary times.</p>
    <b><p>Architecture and Society. </b>The built environment has a permanent and profound
    impact on (our) personal health, productivity and happiness, and on community life. The
    purpose of this course lay the foundation of architectural literacy. The basis of this
    knowledge is found in understanding the relationship between a society and the forms it
    creates. This is accomplished through studying the major components that effect
    architecture: region, culture, and technology. the course follows these factors through
    the history of western civilization, from ancient Greece to contemporary Europe and
    America. Greater emphasis is given to the contemporary period because radical changes in
    technology and resources make this information more pertinent to the present.</p>
    <b><p>The Arts and Politics in Latin America. </b>A study of the interrelationships
    between cultural forms and their socio-historical contexts in the development of Latin
    America from pre-colonial times to the present.</p>
    <b><p>Books in Dialogue: Early Modern and American. </b>This course will study four pairs
    of works: Thomas More's <i>Utopia </i>and Machiavelli's <i>The Prince</i>; Shakespeare's <i>Tempest
    </i>and Swift's <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>; Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography and Thoreau's
    <i>Walden</i>; and Twain's <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> and Ralph Ellison's <i>The Invisible
    Man</i>. The aim will be to explore the ways in which the works respond to one another.
    Such exploration will entail the study of the satire, autobiography, and novel--and how
    the author develops his thematic interests through the manipulation of the literary forms.</p>
    <b><p>Democracy and Its Limits: The Modern Experience. </b>This course examines some
    difficulties stemming from the theory and practice of modern democratic life, especially
    in the context of American democracy. The course examines such issues by a careful and
    intensive reading of some classic writings on democracy. In addition, attention will be
    paid to the historical circumstances and contemporary conditions of democracy in the
    United States. The aim is for the student to acquire a more well-rounded and critical
    perspective on the situation of democracy in modern life.</p>
    <b><p>Drama and Dance in Western Cultures: 1603 to Present. </b>Drama and dance are modes
    of creative expression used to communicate ideas, values, stories and myths which help
    define a community or culture. Both art forms employ the human body as the medium through
    which an audience may be engaged. Through ever-changing conventions, drama and dance
    reshape human experience into patterns which help us order our perceptions about the world
    in which we live. This course will focus primarily on principal themes in western culture
    as expressed in drama and dance.</p>
    <b><p>Humanities: Renaissance to Present. </b>Chronological survey of human civilization
    from the eve of the New World and African colonization, concluding with the contemporary
    world.</p>
    <b><p>Technology and Society: Introduction to Science, Technology and Society. </b>This
    course is an introduction to the social, historical, and ethical contexts of knowledge,
    science and technology. Although science and technology are perhaps the defining features
    of contemporary Western society, all cultures have distinct forms of knowledge and
    technical practices, which reflect their relationships to the natural world and other
    peoples. In this course we will discuss a range of questions relevant to scientists,
    engineers, and the general public, about the causes and contents of scientific and
    technical information, basing these discussions on a broad historical understanding of
    science and technology in various cultures.</p>
    <b><p>The Making of American Cultures, 1600-1877. </b>This course introduces students to
    the history of the United States before 1877. It focuses on the creation of a distinctive
    set of American cultures. Central themes include the colonial meeting of Spanish, French,
    English, native American, and African American cultures; the development of distinctly
    American Creole cultures in the eighteenth century; race and conquest; the American
    Revolution and the creation of a republican political culture; the transformation of that
    political culture through struggles over industrialization and wage labor, slavery, and
    women's rights; and the revolution in American political culture and social relations
    during the Civil War and Reconstruction.</p>
    <b><p>Russia: From Empire to Federation. </b>This course is designed to familiarize
    students with Russia--its culture, history, politics, economy, peoples, languages,
    traditions, and role in the world today. Upon completion of the course students will be
    able to understand and discuss intelligently past and current events relating to Russia.
    They also will have gained a familiarity with the many perspectives available for studying
    a country that continues to play a significant role in world events. And beyond all this,
    they should have a good background for discussion of major events relating to Russia and
    problems in the twentieth-century world.</p>
  </dir>
  <p><b><a name="TRAD104" >104.</a> Topics in Culture and
  Civilization </b>(3) I Explores select topics in human culture in the context of how
  humans, as historical beings, are shaped by the thoughts and actions of our predecessors;
  and that we will influence the lives of those who follow us. The course examines culture
  as a distinct heritage of ideas, values, and artistic expressions that undergo continual
  adaptation due to social changes. <dir>
    <b><p>Comparative Religions. </b>A study of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, including
    both ancient and modern developments in their cultural contexts.</p>
    <b><p>Critical Cultural Concepts. </b>This course examines--through literature, film, art,
    and philosophy&#151;different concepts critical to the shaping of primarily
    &quot;Western&quot; culture(s), with a glance at similar concepts in
    &quot;non-Western&quot; cultures. The course is also &quot;critical&quot; in the sense
    that it asks students, through virtually weekly take-home quizzes, to critique these
    concepts, taking the wheat and letting the chaff be still. Topics may include the ideology
    of war or human rights; the problem of evil; the figure of the Trickster; and others. </p>
    <b><p>Eroticism and Love in the Middle Ages. </b>Courtly love was a discovery of the High
    Middle Ages and became the dominant theme in literature, the arts, philosophy, and even in
    religion. This course will examine the concept of love as discussed by medieval poets from
    the 11th through the 15th centuries and cover the wide spectrum of European history
    culture seen through the lenses of the theme of &quot;love.&quot;</p>
    <b><p>Intellectual Foundations of International Relations: Classic Theories and Modern
    Debate. </b>Addresses the origins and context of international relations theory in an
    historical context as well as referring to recent disputes.</p>
    <p><strong>Justice and Virtue.</strong> This course will introduce you to some of the
    central and historically important questions and ideas in moral and political thought and
    philosophy through the works of some of the most important thinkers in the western
    tradition.</p>
    <p><b>Mind, Matter and God. </b>Mind, Matter and God is a historical survey of the western
    philosophical conceptions of mind, matter and God starting with the ideas of the ancient
    Greeks and advancing to include primary figures in the medieval, early modern and,
    possibly, contemporary periods. The primary aims of the course are to acquaint students
    with a set of ideas that are fundamental to western culture and to foster critical
    thinking on abstract questions of profound intellectual and cultural importance.</p>
    <b><p>Oral and Spiritual Roots of Traditional Cultures. </b>Exploration of the cultural
    insights in two mythological traditions: Ancient Mediterranean, origin or Western
    rationality and monotheistic belief; Native American, influences now being recognized.</p>
    <b><p>Science and Inquiry. </b>The effects of modern science on western civilization have
    been profound. A moment's thought will reveal applications of science that have
    transformed our way of life. But aside from its practical benefits (and costs!), modern
    science has had an equally profound intellectual impact. An educated man or woman at the
    close of the twentieth century has a vastly different view of the world, and of the power
    of science to reveal that world, from the views of Aristotle, of Dante or even of Newton.
    This transformation has been brought about in large part by the development of scientific
    thought. In this course we shall examine the distinctive features of scientific inquiry.
    We shall aim to understand the power and also the limitations of scientific methods.</p>
