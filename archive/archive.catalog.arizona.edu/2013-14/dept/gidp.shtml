<p align="center" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><b>Excellence 
through Intellectual Fusion</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Graduate Interdisciplinary Programs (GIDPs) 
transcend departmental boundaries by facilitating cutting edge teaching and 
research where traditional disciplines interface. Because there are no clear 
demarcations between the areas of research in a given GIDP, the fusion of ideas, 
techniques<span class="msoIns"><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none">,</span></font></span> 
and expertise provide an essential foundation to a wide spectrum of endeavors by 
academia, the private sector, and especially by the high technology industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The 16 Graduate Interdisciplinary Programs are an integral part of the 
Mission Statement of the University of Arizona, and student enthusiasm for the 
programs is one of their strongest characteristics. There is now universal 
acceptance by academia, as well as in the private sector, that scientific 
innovation takes place through the synthesis of ideas that cross disciplinary 
boundaries<span class="msoIns"><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none">.</span></font></span> 
This leads to the accepted high value of interdisciplinarity, which has fueled 
the interests of top notch applicants. In 2003, GIDPs produced 14% of all 
Ph.D. degrees at the University of Arizona. </p>
<p>Interdisciplinary excellence among faculty is enhanced through GIDPs. Faculty 
members join interdisciplinary programs because GIDPs provide a formal mechanism 
for campus-wide collaborations in both teaching and research. Faculty 
participating in GIDPs develop strong partnerships with academic and research 
institutes campus-wide, state-wide and nationally. Indeed, faculty are attracted 
to the University of Arizona because of interdisciplinary ventures.
Currently, 611 faculty from 14 colleges and 84 departments are actively involved 
in GIDPs at the University of Arizona.<b>
</b>This strong network of cooperative 
relationships signifies the Intellectual Fusion put into practice through The 
University of Arizona'sGraduate Interdisciplinary Programs. </p>

<span class="msoIns">
<font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none">and the Vice President for Research, Graduate Studies and

the college deans and department heads whose faculty are involved in GIDP 
activities.&nbsp; In addition, the programs receive funding from the central 
administration. The GIDP Administrative Office advocates for program leadership, 
faculty, and students, by addressing issues related to the individual program 
administration and funding. </p>
<p>The Graduate Interdisciplinary Programs Advisory Council (GIDPAC) addresses 
issues relating to the success of the Programs, including student support and 
developing new initiatives to promote the GIDPs as a university-wide system for 
graduate education. GIDPAC meets regularly with Central Administration, 
participating Deans and Department Heads, and also with GIDP Chairs and 
Coordinators. </p>
<p align="center" style="text-align: left"><b>The Future is Already Present; 
Crossing Scientific Boundaries </b></p>
<font size="2" class="style1">The ever increasing need for highly trained educators and researchers is 
optimally met by individuals who have been educated in an interdisciplinary 
environment, and who are able to promote the exchange of ideas among a wide 
range of paradigms and areas of specialization.&nbsp; The Graduate Interdisciplinary 
Programs provide an environment that fosters independent thinking and conceptual 
creativity.&nbsp; The ultimate goal of GIDPs is to provide a cadre of scientists and 
educators who, through interdisciplinary training, are able to develop new and 
imaginative methods of teaching and research, and create new fields of 
endeavors.&nbsp; GIDP students develop independent technical and intellectual skills 
and are encouraged to broaden their abilities and experiences. Graduate 
Interdisciplinary Programs produce competitive investigators who are successful 
in both academia and in private enterprise. As news-breaking research 
advances, so does the focus of GIDPs.
