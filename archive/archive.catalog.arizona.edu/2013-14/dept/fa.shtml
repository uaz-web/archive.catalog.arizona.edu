<p>The College of Fine Arts prepares students to create, to teach, to
participate in, to understand, and to value the arts; to sustain excellence in
teaching, creative expression, and research in the arts; and to be a source of
art, knowledge, and inspiration about the arts for Arizona and the nation.
Students learn to integrate the arts into the everyday life of Arizona citizens;
to promote the arts as a means to understand our diverse and pluralistic world;
and to articulate the value of artistic intelligence as a mode of thinking and
discovery.</p>
<p>The College'saccomplished faculty and alumni enjoy a world-class
reputation and contribute to our identity as a distinguished student-centered
place of learning and creative inquiry. Each member of the faculty maintains
strong enthusiasm for cultivating the greatest possible potential for students
who study with us, as well as pursuing excellence in their individual areas of
creative and research expertise.</p>
<p>The College is also home to the Peter Treistman Fine Arts Center for New
Media and the Wells Fargo Digital Imaging Laboratory, two of our digital arts
research and learning facilities, as well as the Lab Theatre, Marroney Theatre,
Crowder Hall, Holsclaw Hall, and the Joseph Gross and Lionel Rombach Galleries.</p>
<p>The College takes great pride in its service to the community. Each year,
more than 100,000 people attend our exhibits, performances, and lecture series
and seminars, and K-12 educational outreach programs.</p>
