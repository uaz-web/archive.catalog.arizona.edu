<h4 align="center">Class Attendance and Administrative Drop</h4>
  <p>Students are expected to be regular and punctual in class attendance. The
  University believes that students themselves are primarily responsible for
  attendance. Instructors will provide students with written statements of their
  policies with respect to absences. Excessive or extended absence from class is
  sufficient reason for the instructor to recommend that the student be
  administratively dropped from the course. For those courses in which
  enrollment is limited, missing the first class session may be interpreted as
  excessive absence. If this action is filed in the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
 <a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">Office of the Registrar</a> by the
  end of the fourth week of classes, it will result in cancellation of
  registration in the course. The date received by the Office of the Registrar determines how
  the administrative drop affects the student'sacademic record:
  <ul>
    <li>Prior to the end of the 4th week of classes in Fall/Spring (or the end
      of the first week in a Summer term), the course will be deleted from the
      student'srecord at the end of the semester.</li>
    <li>An administrative drop in weeks five through eight of Fall/Spring
      (second week in a Summer term) will result in the <a href="grade.htm"> grade</a> of
      W or E (F if a
      student is enrolled in the class Pass/Fail). This grade is determined by
      the course instructor.</li>
    <li>The grade of XO is awarded for students who
      are administratively dropped for courses taken for <a href="audit.htm">audit</a>
      after the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
      <a href="http://www.registrar.arizona.edu">deadline</a>
      to drop without a grade of W.</li>
    <li>After the end of the 8th week of classes in Fall/Spring (end of the
      third week in a Summer term), administrative drops will not be processed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The student may notify the <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
  <a href="http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/contactinformation">Dean of
  Students Office</a> when an absence
  from class of one week or more is unavoidable. The office will maintain a file
  of such reports available to instructors upon request.</p>
  <h4>PLEASE NOTE:</h4>
<p>Administrative drop is an instructor's option, not an obligation.
  Instructors are not required to drop students who fail to attend class. Any
  student who intends to drop or withdraw from a course must do so following <a href="dropadd.htm">drop
and withdrawal</a>
  instructions. Students who are
  enrolled in a course but fail to attend class will receive an E grade in the
  course.</p>
