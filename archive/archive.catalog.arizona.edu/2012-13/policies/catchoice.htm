<h2 align="center">Academic Policies</h2>
<h4 align="center">Choice of Catalog&nbsp;
</h4>
  <p>The General Catalog is the University's primary official source of
  departmental, college and university-wide information related to academic
  programs. Courses, programs and policies that govern progress towards
  completion of an undergraduate degree are described in the General Catalog.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
  Students maintaining <a href="contenrl.htm">continuous enrollment</a> follow
  the requirements outlined by the Catalog in effect when they first enroll in 
  the University of Arizona or in a
  public Arizona community college or university (i.e., term of admission). The 
  Catalog of the term of admission prescribes, at the minimum, the General 
  Education curriculum and the set of academic policies that govern progress 
  toward completion of a degree.&nbsp; The Catalog of the term of admission also 
  describes the program requirements of the student's major(s) and minor(s), 
  unless the student selects a subsequent Catalog in order to declare a newly 
  established major or minor that was unavailable during the term of admission.&nbsp; 
  In this situation, the Catalog of the admission term holds for the degree 
  components indicated above, but a more recent Catalog is designated for (a) 
  the major requirements, associated pre-professional requirements and related policies, or (b) the minor requirements and 
  related policies.&nbsp; Thus, a student's primary Catalog may be supplemented 
  by one or more newer Catalogs that pertain solely to a major and/or a minor.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
  Alternatively, a student may choose 
  to follow all of the program and policy requirements outlined by any single Catalog in effect during
  subsequent terms of continuous enrollment. Each student is responsible for
  knowing and abiding by the policies described in the Catalog chosen.&nbsp; See
  <a href="../../allcats.html">All UA Academic
  Catalogs</a>.</p>
  <p>Students admitted or readmitted to a public Arizona community college or
  university during a summer term follow the requirements of the Catalog in
  effect the following Fall semester. Students transferring among Arizona public
  higher education institutions must meet the admission requirements, residency
  requirements, and all curricular and academic requirements of the
  degree-granting institution.</p>
