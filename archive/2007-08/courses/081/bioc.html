This will greatly save time of visually parsing pages of output from such programs as Blast and enable the student to better data mine the massive amounts of data in genomic and biological databases. The student will also learn concepts in computers so that they can easily collaborate with computational researchers and programmers. Graduate-level requirements include writing a functional specification that is due at mid-term and at the end of the semester. A functional specification will describe a computational problem that the student wants solved to aid in their biological research. <br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Identical to:</b>&nbsp;  MCB 500; MCB  is home department.<br><b>May be convened with:</b>&nbsp; BIOC 400.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall.<!--BIOC500 ends-->
