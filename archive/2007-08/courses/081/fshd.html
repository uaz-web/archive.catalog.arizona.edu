By experiencing children’s social, emotional, language, or motor development first hand, the concepts taught in class should become clearer and relevant. The laboratory experience is designed to make up for this deficit in the course and provide training in observing and recording young children’s behaviors.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall, Spring.<!--FSHD223L ends-->
