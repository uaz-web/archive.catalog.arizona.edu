empirical tests of these models. As much as any field of biology, population genetics has
been divided into a theoretical and an empirical branch. However, these two bodies of
knowledge are intimately related and this course will cover both in roughly equal amounts.

natural populations (mutation, drift, selection, migration, recombination, mating
patterns, population size and population subdivision), methods of measuring genetic
variation in nature, and experimental tests of important ideas in population genetics. The
course will also cover a few more specialized topics such as transposable elements, the
evolution of multigene families, and molecular clocks. P, ECOL 182, ECOL 335; either ECOL
