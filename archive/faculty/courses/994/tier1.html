  assess environmental problems and technology: e.g., CAP water, air pollution,
  solar cookers, and water use in the arid southwest.<b></p>
  <p>Planet Earth: Evolution of the Habitable World</b> This course develops a
  planetary perspective on the evolutionary processes that shaped Earth
  throughout history. We will examine why Earth is habitable, that is, why any
  kind of life can live on it, we will discuss the unique influences that
  biological processes and atmosphere/ocean systems have on each other, and we
  will review current notions of climate change, including evidence for the
  influence of human activities on it. This interdisciplinary treatment of Earth
  and its sister planets will encourage students to think about how science and
  engineering must be applied to today's challenges if humankind is to have a
  promising future on (and off) this planet.</p>

  <b>
  <p>The Concepts of Physical Science</b> This is a course inquiring into basic
  concepts used by every physical science in its exploration of the world. The
  concepts originate in physics, which offers the framework on which other
  disciplines are build. Applications of the concepts are made in the course,
  not just to traditional physics problems, but to problems in many other
  scientific disciplines. In the course we will explore the development of the
  concepts from their intuitive beginnings to their present forms. In the
  process, we will see how science searches for a logically consistent
  explanation of the world, and how the creation of these concepts has
  influenced our perception of that world.<b></p>
  <p>The Physical Universe</b> The Physical Universe presents the astronomical
  phenomena of the universe in the context of physical science.<b></p>
  <p>The Role of Time in Science</b> The central theme in the course is time;
  how we decide what it is, how we measure it, and how our view of it has
  changed as we learn more about the natural world. The course will discuss many
  sorts of natural clocks, both cyclic (atoms, planet orbits, neutron stars) and
  non-cyclic growth and decay (chemical and nuclear reactions, radioactivity,
  geological processes, the birth and death of stars), and the time scales on
  which each can be used. We will see how a few central principles keep
  recurring in our attempt to understand the working of these clocks.
  Ultimately, we will discuss how Einstein had to change our ideas about time
  measurement in order to accommodate these principles, and how the
  accommodation has lead to our present view of the universe.<b></p>
  <p>The Universe and Humanity: Origin and Destiny</b> This course explores the
  deep relationships that connect the largest structures in the universe to the
  world of atoms and subatomic particles. Topics covered begin with the
  scientific method and tools of science, proceed to fundamental physical
  concepts and processes that govern the natural world, and move on to a study
  of features of the natural world based upon fundamental laws of nature. This
  knowledge is used to create a broad perspective for understanding the origin
  and evolution of our Milky Way Galaxy, our Solar System, and their common
  cosmic heritage.<b></p>
  <p>Life in the Universe</b> The course will emphasize to the student how
  information from different fields of science can be brought together to
  address a problem and, most importantly, how the scientific method can be used
  to attach problems which at first may seem intractable. One major goal of the
  course will be to impart to the student the wonder, uniqueness, and fragility
  of life on Earth.</p>

  <p>History of Western Civilization: From the Rise of Cities to the Counter
  Reformat</b> This course explores the civilizations of the West by considering
  the development of the ideas and ideologies that shaped the institutions of
  the West, development directed by Human interaction and conflict on a social,
  political, religious, and cultural level, in addition to the intellectual.
  Themes of particular interest include the structure and dynamics of power,
  competing configurations of deity and ritual, image and architecture as tools
  in the acquisition of authority, and the construction of a social normative on
  the grounds of class, culture and gender.<b></p>
  <p>Humanities: Ancient Times to Renaissance</b> Chronological survey of human
  civilizations from pre-history to the renaissance. Students will be introduced
  to the critical analysis of the literacy and artistic expressions that
  constitute the ideas and values of our collective heritage. Emphasis will be
  placed on the interrelation of Western and non-Western cultures and on the
  inter-perspectives including science, gender and psychology, politics, social
  conditions, religion and philosophy.<b></p>
  <p>In the Beginning: Roots of Western Culture</b> The roots of
  &quot;western&quot; tradition(s) are often traced to the Classical Greeks.
  However, by the time that work on the Parthenon had begun, the peoples of the
  Near East and Northeastern Africa had already witnessed the rise and fall of a
  series of great civilizations for over ten thousand years. In fact, many of
  the elements of &quot;classical&quot; civilization can be traced to
  experiments made in this distant past.<b></p>
  <p>Western Culture: The Italian Perspective: Antiquity through the Middle Ages</b>
  From Antiquity through the Middle Ages. Taught in English.<b></p>
  <p>World History to 1600</b> Survey of topics in world history to 1600.<b></p>
  <p>Books in Dialogue: Classical to Medieval</b> This course aims to provide
  solid grounding in the Western intellectual and cultural tradition through
  pairing of central literary, philosophical, and theological works. The second
  work in each pair will be studied as a response to the first: e.g., The Aeneid
  to The Odyssey and Aristotle's Ethics to Plato's. Students will be encouraged
  to deal with each of the paired texts individually and comparatively and to
  compare members of different pairs, e.g., Augustine with Plato, and
  non-scriptural works of the Christian era with the selections from the Bible.</p>

103.</a> Western Cultures and Civilizations: Renaissance to Present </b>(3) I II
Historical development and fundamental concepts of western civilization, from
the Renaissance to the present. Examines the heritage of ideas, values, and
artistic expressions that have shaped western tradition since the Renaissance.
<dir>
  <b>
  <p>Architecture and Society</b> The built environment has, 'a permanent and
  profound impact on (our) personal health, productivity and happiness, and on
  community life.' The purpose of this course lay the foundation of
  architectural literacy. The basis of this knowledge is found in understanding
  the relationship between a society and the forms it creates. This is
  accomplished through studying the major components that effect architecture:
  region, culture, and technology. the course follows these factors through the
  history of western civilization, from ancient Greece to contemporary Europe
  and America. Greater emphasis is given to the contemporary period because
  radical changes in technology and resources make this information more
  pertinent to the present.<b></p>
  <p>The Arts and Politics in Latin America</b> A study of the
  interrelationships between cultural forms and their socio-historical contexts
  in the development of Latin America from pre-colonial times to the present.<b></p>
  <p>Books in Dialogue: Early Modern and American</b> This course will study
  four pairs of works: Thomas More's Utopia and Machiavelli's The Prince;
  Shakespeare's Tempest and Swift's Gulliver's Travels; Benjamin Franklin's
  Autobiography and Thoreau's Walden; and Twain's Huckleberry Finn and Ralph
  Ellison's The Invisible Man. The aim will be to explore the ways in which the
  works respond to one another. Such exploration will entail the study of the
  satire, autobiography, and novel--and how the author develops his thematic
  interests through the manipulation of the literary forms.<b></p>
  <p>Democracy and Its Limits: The Modern Experience</b> This course examines
  some difficulties stemming from the theory and practice of modern democratic
  life, especially in the context of American democracy. The course examines
  such issues by a careful and intensive reading of some classic writings on
  democracy. In addition, attention will be paid to the historical circumstances
  and contemporary conditions of democracy in the United States. The aim is for
  the student to acquire a more well-rounded and critical perspective on the
  situation of democracy in modern life.<b></p>
  <p>Drama and Dance in Western Cultures: 1603 to Present</b> Drama and dance
  are modes of creative expression used to communicate ideas, values, stories
  and myths which help define a community or culture. Both art forms employ the
  human body as the medium through which an audience may be engaged. Through
  ever-changing conventions, drama and dance reshape human experience into
  patterns which help us order our perceptions about the world in which we live.
  This course will focus primarily on principal themes in western culture as
  expressed in drama and dance.<b></p>
  <p>Humanities: Renaissance to Present</b> Chronological survey of human
  civilization from the eve of the New World and African colonization,
  concluding with the contemporary world.<b></p>
  <p>Technology and Society: Introduction to Science, Technology and Society</b>
  This course is an introduction to the social, historical, and ethical contexts
  of knowledge, science and technology. Although science and technology are
  perhaps the defining features of contemporary Western society, all cultures
  have distinct forms of knowledge and technical practices, which reflect their
  relationships to the natural world and other peoples. In this course we will
  discuss a range of questions relevant to scientists, engineers, and the
  general public, about the causes and contents of scientific and technical
  information, basing these discussions on a broad historical understanding of
  science and technology in various cultures.<b></p>
  <p>The Making of American Cultures, 1600-1877</b> This course introduces
  students to the history of the United States before 1877. It focuses on the
  creation of a distinctive set of American cultures. Central themes include the
  colonial meeting of Spanish, French, English, native American, and African
  American cultures; the development of distinctly American Creole cultures in
  the eighteenth century; race and conquest; the American Revolution and the
  creation of a republican political culture; the transformation of that
  political culture through struggles over industrialization and wage labor,
  slavery, and women's rights; and the revolution in American political culture
  and social relations during the Civil War and Reconstruction.<b></p>
  <p>Russia: From Empire to Federation</b> This course is designed to
  familiarize students with Russia--its culture, history, politics, economy,
  peoples, languages, traditions, and role in the world today. Upon completion
  of the course students will be able to understand and discuss intelligently
  past and current events relating to Russia. They also will have gained a
  familiarity with the many perspectives available for studying a country that
  continues to play a significant role in world events. And beyond all this,
  they should have a good background for discussion of major events relating to
  Russia and problems in the twentieth-century world.<b></p>
  <p>The Americas - Renaissance to the Present Day</b> This course will expose
  students to major movements in the Americas from the Renaissance to
  contemporary times.</p>

104.</a> Topics in Culture and Civilization </b>(3) I II Explores select topics
in human culture in the context of how humans, as historical beings, are shaped
by the thoughts and actions of our predecessors; and that we will influence the
lives of those who follow us. The course examines culture as a distinct heritage
of ideas, values, and artistic expressions that undergo continual adaptation due
to social changes. Comparative Religions. A study of Judaism, Christianity and
Islam, including both ancient and
<dir>
  <b>
  <p>Intellectual Foundations of International Relations: Classical Theories
  &amp; Modern</b> Addresses the origins and context of international relations
  theory in an historical context as well as referring to recent disputes.<b></p>
  <p>Justice and Virtue</b> This course will introduce you to some of the
  central and historically important questions and ideas in moral and political
  thought and philosophy through the works of some of the most important
  thinkers in the western tradition.<b></p>
  <p>Comparative Religions</b> A study of Judaism, Christianity and Islam,
  including both ancient and modern developments in their cultural contexts.<b></p>
  <p>Eroticism and Love in the Middle Ages</b> Courtly love was a discovery of
  the High Middle Ages and became the dominant theme in literature, the arts,
  philosophy, and even in religion. This course will examine the concept of love
  as discussed by medieval poets from the 11th through the 15th centuries and
  cover the wide spectrum of European history culture seen through the lenses of
  the theme of &quot;love.&quot;<b></p>
  <p>Mind, Matter and God</b> Mind, Matter and God is a historical survey of the
  western philosophical conceptions of mind, matter and God starting with the
  ideas of the ancient Greeks and advancing to include primary figures in the
  medieval, early modern and, possibly, contemporary periods. The primary aims
  of the course are to acquaint students with a set of ideas that are
  fundamental to western culture and to foster critical thinking on abstract
  questions of profound intellectual and cultural importance.<b></p>
  <p>Oral and Spiritual Roots of Traditional Cultures</b> Exploration of the
  cultural insights in two mythological traditions: Ancient Mediterranean,
  origin or Western rationality and monotheistic belief; Native American,
  influences now being recognized.<b></p>
  <p>Science and Inquiry</b> The effects of modern science on western
  civilization have been profound. A moment's thought will reveal applications
  of science that have transformed our way of life. But aside from its practical
  benefits (and costs!), modern science has had an equally profound intellectual
  impact. An educated man or woman at the close of the twentieth century has a
  vastly different view of the world, and of the power of science to reveal that
  world, from the views of Aristotle, of Dante or even of Newton. This
  transformation has been brought about in large part by the development of
  scientific thought. In this course we shall examine the distinctive features
  of scientific inquiry. We shall aim to understand the power and also the
  limitations of scientific methods.<b></p>
  <p>Critical Concepts in Western Culture</b> Course focuses on an idea, theme
  or symbolic figure important to Western and other cultures since ancient
  times.<b></p>
  <p>Critical Cultural Concepts</b> This course examines--through literature,
  film, art, and philosophy-different concepts critical to the shaping of
  primarily &quot;Western&quot; culture(s), with a glance at similar concepts in
  &quot;non-Western&quot; cultures. The course is also &quot;critical&quot; in
  the sense that it asks students, through virtually weekly take-home quizzes,
  to critique these concepts, taking the wheat and letting the chaff be still.
  Topics may include the ideology of war or human rights; the problem of evil;
  the figure of the Trickster; and others.<b></p>
  <p>Introduction to African American Literature</b> Introduction to African
  American literature will explore the linguistic and cultural roots and
  traditions of literary writing by African Americans in three centuries of
  American history focusing on select readings in poetry, drama, and fictional
  prose. The overall goal of the course is to introduce students to the history
  of the different genres, contexts, and content of literary production by
  African American writers from the 1700s to the late 20th century.</p>
