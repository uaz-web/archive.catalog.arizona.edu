195A</a> Freshman Colloquium </b>(1) I II&nbsp; See subtitles below.</p>
<blockquote>
  <font size="2">
  <p></font><font size="3"><strong>Information Literacy in the Fine Arts and
  Humanities</strong> - The amount of information doubles approximately every 7
  years challenging each of us to learn to access, organize and evaluate this
  critical component of student learning. This course will explore different
  aspects of information seeking skills such as search strategies, technology
  and critical thinking skills. Student projects will revolve around a theme or
  themes in the fine arts and humanities.</p>
  <p><strong>Radioactive Tracers in Clinical Medicine</strong> - This course
  will briefly cover how radioactive tracers are used in clinical medicine, with
  examples of imaging studies in actual patients. The field of nuclear medicine
  uses radiotracers in applications that cover virtually every medical
  discipline. This colloquium will introduce the student to some of these
  applications in cancer, heart disease, stroke, epilepsy, AIDS, infectious
  disease, and a variety of other disorders in which nuclear medicine studies
  yield valuable clinical information.</p>
  <p><strong>Water Resources in the Tucson Basin: Natural Resources</strong> -
  In the Western U.S. it is said, &quot;Whiskey is for drinking and water is for
  fighting.&quot; History has proved this to be all too true. Here&#146;s a chance
  to see what all the fighting is about, while developing library and
  presentation skills. The semester&#146;s results will be posted on class web
  page. Join us!</p>
  <p><strong>Information Literacy in the Sciences</strong> - The amount of
  information doubles approximately every seven years challenging each of us to
  learn to access, evaluate and manage this critical component of knowledge.
  This course will explore different aspects of information literacy including
  technology, economics, social structure and critical evaluation.</p>
  <p><strong>Water, Quality and the Environment </strong>- This course will
  focus on issues related to water, water quality, water pollution, and water
  use and their relations to the environment and humanity. Students will be
  required to make one presentation on a chosen topic dealing with any
  water-related issue. The topics to be covered in this colloquium include:
  basic chemistry and composition of water; the natural water cycle in the
  environment; definition and discussion of &quot;clean&quot; versus
  &quot;polluted&quot; water; is water being used and/or abused by humans? Is
  water quality changing?</p>
  <p><strong>How to Save the American Democratic Institutions</strong> - The
  colloquium is based on a variety of readings, scholarly discussion, and
  intellectual debate. Students will learn ideas about the challenges of the
  21st century and alternative solutions to vital problems of our society.
  Students will have an opportunity to practice writing term papers, giving
  presentations and participating in discussions.</p>
  <p><strong>Berlin - A Topography of Culture and History</strong> - In this
  course, we will take a conceptual walk through the Berlin of this century to
  view, address and reflect on the significance of various locales in
  relationship to German culture. The &quot;tour&quot; will begin at the
  Reichstag (German Parliament) in 1919, and end with a view of the Potsdamer
  Platz today.</p>
  <p><strong>The Science and Ethics of Risk and Safety</strong> - Humans and all
  other living things on earth evolved in a hostile environment, naturally
  polluted with dust, noise, electromagnetic waves, radiation, smoke,
  radioactivity, chemicals and gases. The environment has never been clean or
  risk free and nothing we do is risk free. In fact, without risk, humans wouldn&#146;t
  have evolved. This seminar will be especially valuable for students in
  pre-law, pre-med., political science and philosophy.</p>
  <p><strong>Data Analysis: Digging Out the Truth in Current Issues </strong>-
  The colloquium presents issues of current interest in areas not commonly
  associated with mathematics. Discussion and study of each issue will show that
  the use of data analysis tools is critical in achieving a satisfactory
  conclusion. The problems have been selected carefully. They are contemporary
  issues that have attracted public attention and debate. Yet, the audience only
  requires good sense and standard high school mathematics to work with them.
  Part One: Surviving in a Technological Society. Seven problems of current
  interest. Part Two: Fair Lending Practices: Do banks discriminate? A Case
  Study.</p>
  <p><strong>Earth Explorations </strong>- This colloquium will explore a range
  of global and local environmental topics through class and small group
  discussions. We will address the following: What is Global Change, the
  Greenhouse Effect and the Ozone Hole? What can we do about it? What is the
  role of environmental studies in today's world? How can the internet be used
  to improve our understanding of environmental issues?</p>
  <p><strong>Law and Public Policy: Analyzing Cases and Statutes and the Policy
  Issues Which Shape Them</strong> - This class will examine how law forms
  through legislative and judicial processes. The class will closely scrutinize
  several court cases and at least one legislative scheme. Class discussions
  will focus on conflicting social and economic issues that are at issue in the
  cases or statutes. Students will be required to hypothesize alternatives to
  the existing law, and analyze the consequences and compromises contained in
  their hypotheses.</p>
  <p><strong>If It&#146;s on the News, It Must Be True: Information Literacy Skills
  for the Information Age</strong> - In this class, you will learn information
  literacy and technology skills while examining the issue of mass media news
  literacy. Consumers of news and information in the Information Age should know
  how what they watch, read or log on to is produced. You will learn to be a
  critical evaluator of information. You will also work on a project that
  fulfills a personal information need.</p>
  <p><strong>Berlin - A Topography of Culture and History</strong> - In this
  course, we will take a conceptual walk through the Berlin of this century to
  view, address and reflect on the significance of various locales in
  relationship to German culture. The &quot;tour&quot; will begin at the
  Reichstag (German Parliament) in 1919, and end with a view of the Potsdamer
  Platz today.</p>
  <p><strong>The Mathematics of Natural Patterns</strong> - Have you ever
  noticed the similarities between sand ripples on the beach, the ribs of a
  Saguaro cactus and your fingerprints? This colloquium will explore these and
  many other striking instances of pattern formation in nature. We will discuss
  how mathematicians and physicists have classified regular structures on the
  basis of their symmetries and model how nature creates patterns. Through
  visits to experimental laboratories on campus, user-friendly interactive
  computer simulations, and Web surfing, students will discover the beautiful
  simplicity of natural patterns.</p>
  <p><strong>Data Analysis: Digging Out the Truth in Current Issues</strong> -
  The colloquium presents issues of current interest in areas not commonly
  associated with mathematics. Discussion and study of each issue will show that
  the use of data analysis tools is critical in achieving a satisfactory
  conclusion. The problems have been selected carefully. They are contemporary
  issues that have attracted public attention and debate. Yet, the audience only
  requires good sense and standard high school mathematics to work with them.
  Part One: Surviving in a Technological Society. Seven problems of current
  interest. Part Two: Fair Lending Practices: Do banks discriminate? A Case
  Study.</p>
  <p><strong>Crime and Justice in the United States </strong>- This course is
  designed to introduce students to the field of criminology and criminal
  justice. Crime rates in the US are higher than any time in the recent past and
  prison populations are larger than at any time in history. Criminology is the
  scientific study of the causes of crime and delinquency and includes study of
  changes in the amount of crime and in the types of crimes people commit.
  Criminal justice is concerned with the treatment of crime by the legal system,
  including the justifications for imprisonment. This colloquium will introduce
  students to these field and the issues currently confronting them. Principles
  in criminology and criminal justice will be illustrated by a focus on
  contemporary issues.</font></p>
