 Models of Resistance, Post 16th Cent. African Liberation Movements in Southeast
 </b> (3)  I There were actually several "Souths" during  the Holocaust of Enslavement. However, courses taught in the era of African enslavement have tended to focus on the northern most regions, such as Virginia, which are often taken to represent-if not constitute-the South. This course looks at the other "South" and the French and Spanish colonizers of  South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana.

 African-American Autobiographies:  Women and Their Histories
 </b> (3)  I II Students will gain insight into the historical and cultural factors  that have created, and continue to perpetuate gender and ethnic inequity.

It is my goal that through the course material students will see how African Americans are constantly recreating themselves in the face of adversity. (Identical with  W S 306).
<p>
<p><b><a name="AFAS307" >AFAS 307</a>

 Writers, Women and the Gods: The Caribbean Novel
 </b> (3) [Rpt./ 2]  I  In order to conceptualize the way gender and ethnicity has  shaped women's lives in the public and private domain students will "hear" the voices of African American women in ethnography, history  and literature as we discuss the Africana concepts of life, health, beauty and family. The experiences of these women, as expressed in  literature have become "formidable" presences in African American culture and history. The self-expression and self-definition, expressed  by African American womens' voices have generated social and political changes in American history that have also impacted the dominant  Euro-American culture of American society.
