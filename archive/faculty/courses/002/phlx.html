 Applied Aspects of Program Planning, Implementation and Evaluation I
 </b> (4)  II This course is part one of a two-course sequence on the planning, implementing, and evaluating of health education/health promotion programs.

<p>
<p><b><a name="PHL 532B" >PHL  532B</a>
 Applied Aspects of Program Planning, Implementation and Evaluation I
 </b> (4)  II The purpose of this class will be to expose students to
applied aspects of program planning, implementation and evaluation. Classroom theory must often be adapted in the field to meet real world constraints placed on programs. Time, money, differing agendas of stakeholders, failure to adhere to protocol, being asked to evaluate after the program has commenced, and
failure of the community to understand utility of program models are but a few of the factors that require those responsible for planning, implementing and evaluating to be able to "think on their feet". This class will provide students with a menu of existing service learning opportunities in which to experience first
hand these types of issues.

 Community Assessment and Analysis
 </b> (3)  II This course provides training and experience in community assessment and analysis applicable to public health practice.  It focuses on the assessment of community organization and health needed to guide the development of health services.  Beginning with a systematic description of the cultural and community systems, organizations and partnerships that emerge from these systems, and the information needs of these organizations and partnerships, students will progress to the design of community assessments in collaboration with community partners.  With an emphasis on public health surveillance and community diagnosis, students will draw from multiple disciplines to assess health status and its determinants (social, behavioral, and environmental), needs for helath services, and the capacity and resources of local community and its organizations.  Students will also learn to facilitate and evaluate the use of data for decision-making by partnerships, organizations and policy makers.  The course provides the assessment background needed for planning and evaluation, the next course in the series.
