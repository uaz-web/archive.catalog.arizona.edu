 Mathematics in Life, Society and the World
 </b> (3)  I This course is an introductory survey of a variety of topics such as the history of mathematics and mathematics in art, music, and nature.  Basic mathematical concepts such as critical thinking, logic, algebra, voting systems, population growth and radioactive decay, social choice and problem solving are developed and applied to everyday issues.   P, consent of instructor for non-AIC students.
<p>
<p><b><a name="AISM120" >AISM 120</a>
 College Algebra
 </b> (3)  I II This course for non-mathematics majors and minors covers the basic concepts of algebra, including linear equations and inequalities, relations and functions, quadratic equations, and systems of equations.   P, two entrance units in algebra or an acceptable score on the math readiness test. Consent of instructor for non-AIC students.
<p>
<p><b><a name="AISM121" >AISM 121</a>
 Introduction to Cellular and Molecular Biology
 </b> (4)  I Explores chemistry of biological molecules, the molecular workings of cells, and a biochemical look at diseases such as the common cold, AIDS, and depression.  The interaction between science and society will be discussed, including topics such as genetic engineering and medical ethics.  Weekly labs with investigative exercises with DNA, enzymes, and other biological molecules.   P, AISM 101 or equivalent. Consent of instructor for non-AIC students.
<p>
<p><b><a name="AISM122" >AISM 122</a>
 Biology of Organisms and the Environment
 </b> (4)  II Building on the foundations of knowledge and skills from AISM121, this course explores the functioning of plants and animals and how they adapt to and interact with their environment.  Topics include physiology, genetics, development and reproduction, and ecology.  The central organizing principle of the course is evolution as a way of understanding individual organisms and the diversity of life on earth.  The course will include consideration of contemporary social issues such as health care and environmental ethics.   Field Trips.  P, AISM 121 or equivalent. Consent of instructor for non-AIC students.
