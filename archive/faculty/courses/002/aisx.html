 Colloquium
 </b> (3) [Rpt./ 4]  The topic of "traditional" education of Indian children, youth and adults in becoming contributing members of and to their tribal societies has received minimal attention in the Indian education.  It is the premise of this course that students:

1.  Recognize that traditional tribal education was a complex and deliberate process of preparation through which each tribal individual was brought into the community fold.
2.  Recognize that some aspects of the ways of life of indigenous people of the United States are in marked contrast to Western practice and thought.
3.  Recognize that indigenous peoples are strikingly diverse in their culture, religious practices, and social economic organization.
4.  Recognize that as well as their specific uniquenessness determined by their diversity, there are some shared values among indigneous cultures. This is a temporary course offered Summer II, 2000.
