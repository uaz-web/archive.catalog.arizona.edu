<p><b>224. Models of Resistance: Post
16th Century African Liberation Movements in the Southeast</b> (3) There were actually
several &quot;Souths&quot; during the Holocaust of Enslavement. However, courses taught in
the era of African enslavement have tended to focus on the northern most regions, such as
Virginia, which are often taken to represent-if not constitute-the South. This course
looks at the other &quot;South&quot; and the French and Spanish colonizers of South
Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. It offers a different perspective of the beginnings of
the Great Enslavement and compares and contrasts the lives and struggles of enslaved,
freed, and self-emancipated Africans in the Southwest during the tenure of Spain.
