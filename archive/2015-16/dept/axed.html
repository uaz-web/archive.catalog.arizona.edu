  in agriculture, prepares students for certified teaching careers at the
  secondary school or the community college level. Such teaching positions
  require preparation in the basic sciences, agricultural sciences and
  technology, communications, and knowledge and application of the principles
  and techniques of the teaching-learning process through professional education
  course work.</p>
  <p>The option in teacher education in agriculture, which leads to teaching,
