<h2 align="center">Credits from Community Colleges</h2>

<p>While there is no limit to the total number of units of course work that may be
transferred from an accredited community college to The University of Arizona, no more
than 64 of those units may be applied toward the requirements for a bachelor&#146;s
degree. The choice of the 64 units is at the discretion of the student in consultation
with an advisor. </p>

<p>Transfer students are encouraged to complete freshman and sophomore level general
education course work at their community colleges. Transferability of courses of
independent study, internship, or practicum will be determined by the appropriate
department or college at The University of Arizona and may be restricted both in number of
units and in degree applicability. Students who have taken community college courses in
these categories may petition for an exception. </p>

<p>While all courses offered for transfer will be accepted by the University according to
these rules, the specific lower-division requirements of various curricula vary widely. In
order to complete the baccalaureate program in the normal time span, the student should
consult the appropriate college and the advisor in the appropriate university department
to determine requirements of a particular program. </p>

<p>Community college courses which are equivalent in content to university upper-division
(carrying a course number of 300 or higher) courses will be transferable as equivalents,
but with lower-division credit. These courses need not be repeated at the University, but
will not count toward the required number of upper-division credit hours.</p>
