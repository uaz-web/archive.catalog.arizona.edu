<h3>Absences-Administrative Drop</h3>

<p>Students are expected to be regular and punctual in class attendance. The University
believes that students themselves are primarily responsible for attendance. Instructors
will provide students with written statements of their policies with respect to absences.
Excessive or extended absence from class is sufficient reason for the instructor to
recommend that the student be administratively dropped from the course. For those courses
in which enrollment is limited, missing the first class session may be interpreted as
excessive absence. If this action is filed in the Registrar&#146;s Office by the end of
the fourth week of classes, it will result in cancellation of registration in the course.
The date received by the Registrar determines how the administrative drop affects the
student&#146;s academic record:

<ul>
  <li>Prior to the end of the 4th week of classes in Fall/Spring (or the end of the 1st week
    in a Summer term), the course will be deleted from the student&#146;s record at the end of
    the semester.</li>
  <li>An administrative drop in weeks five through eight of Fall/Spring (2<sup>nd</sup> week
    in a Summer term) will result in the grade of W or E (F if a student is enrolled in the
    class Pass/Fail). This grade is determined by the course instructor.</li>
  <li>After the end of the 8th week of classes in Fall/Spring (end of 3rd week in a Summer
    term), administrative drops will not be processed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The student may notify the Office of the Dean of Students when an absence from class of
one week or more is unavoidable. The office will maintain a file of such reports available
to instructors upon request. </p>

<h3>PLEASE NOTE: </h3>

<p>Administrative drop is an instructor's option, not an obligation. Instructors are not
required to drop students who fail to attend class. Any student who intends to drop or
withdraw from a course must do so following <a href="dropadd.htm">withdrawal</a>
instructions available in the <em>Schedule of Classes. </em>Students who are enrolled in a
course but fail to attend class will receive an E grade in the course.</p>
