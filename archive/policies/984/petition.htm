they believe they deserve redress or exception to university rules, regulations, or
policies regarding academic affairs, such as extension of incomplete grade, choice of
catalog, and degree requirements. Petition forms may be obtained in the Office of the
Registrar or from the college dean. The completed form with all relevant facts and
supporting evidence is submitted to the college dean for recommendation. The dean forwards
the petition and recommendation to the Office of the Registrar, who then forwards the
petition to the University Petitions Committee for action. The decision of the University
Petitions Committee is final.</p>
