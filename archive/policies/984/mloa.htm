<p align="center"><strong>Military Leave of Absence (MLOA)</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="style1">(Policy created on 10/6/08)</p>
<p>The University of Arizona supports students who are members of the United 
States armed forces and reserve units.&nbsp; An undergraduate or graduate 
student who is a member of the U.S. military, National Guard or other armed 
forces reserve unit who is called or ordered to active duty elsewhere may be 
granted a Military Leave of Absence (MLOA) from the University for the period of 
active duty and up to one year after returning from active duty.&nbsp; Students 
with the MLOA need not apply for readmission or pay readmission fees.&nbsp; MLOA 
allows those students to preregister for classes during their priority 
registration period prior to the term when they plan to return to campus.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Military Leave of Absence application is available online from the <a href="http://registrar.arizona.edu/registrarforms">
Registrar&#8217;s Office</a> forms site.&nbsp; The completed application, to be 
submitted to the Registration &amp; Transcripts Office in Administration 210 prior 
to the student&#8217;s departure from the University, must be accompanied by a copy of 
the military orders indicating the date on which the student must report for 
active duty elsewhere.&nbsp; When students are called to active duty after 
classes begin, they should contact the <a href="http://dos.web.arizona.edu/">
Dean of Students Office</a> for a complete withdrawal from the current term, in 
addition to filing the MLOA for subsequent terms.&nbsp; If students receive 
financial aid and/or live in a UA residence hall, they are responsible for 
contacting the <a href="https://financialaid.arizona.edu/Default.aspx">Office of 
Student Financial Aid</a> and/or <a href="http://www.life.arizona.edu/">Office 
of Residence Life</a>.<br />
For assistance with the MLOA form, contact your college dean's office.<br /></p>
