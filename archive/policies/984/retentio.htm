<h2 align="center">Retention of Student Records</h2>

<p>The Office of the Registrar maintains a permanent record of academic work completed by
each student. Support documents for the academic records are kept for three (3) years
after the student graduates or date of last enrollment. After three years, it is assumed
that the student accepts the accuracy of his/her records each semester. Discrepancies in
the academic record should be reported to the Registrar immediately.</p>

<p>When a degree has been certified by the Office of the Registrar, a student&#146;s
academic record may not be altered except in those cases where a procedural or clerical
error has occurred. However, if the student or the University learns facts that were not
known or would not have reasonably been known within the three-year period, the academic
record may be altered and/or the degree may be revoked. </p>
