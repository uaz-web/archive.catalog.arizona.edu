<h2 align="center">Undergraduate Minor Requirements</h2>

<p align="center"><font color="#BA0113">(Policy updated 01/05/04:&nbsp; Added
information about the double use of courses)</font></p>

<p>Colleges or schools, with the approval of the University faculty and the Arizona Board
of Regents, establish the minimum number of units needed to complete an undergraduate
minor administered within that unit. No University of Arizona minor requires fewer than 18
units; some minors require more than 18 units. In most cases, at least nine of the 18
units must be upper-division units.</p>

<p>For information about minimum number of units for a specific minor, consult the
<a href="http://www.arizona.edu/topics/academics">Minor
Requirement Report</a> or contact the department that administers the minor.</p>

<p>Each college determines whether or not its degrees must include a minor; however, a
college may not preclude a student from declaring an existing minor. Minors are
discipline-based; the discipline that labels the minor defines its content. The double use of courses in the minor with
other degree requirements is subject to University General Education, college,
and department policies on double dipping.&nbsp; See the <a href="http://www.gened.arizona.edu/content/general-education-policies-students">General
Education policy</a> and check with your major and minor advisors for
clarification on the double use of any courses. Certification
of a minor at the point of degree audit for graduation indicates that the student has met
the requirements specified by the discipline defining the minor. </p>

<p>Any variation from the prescribed content must be approved by the minor discipline. For
information about course requirements for a specific minor, consult the electronic catalog
at http://catalog.arizona.edu, or contact the department that administers the minor.</p>

<p>Students also have the option of declaring a thematic minor. The thematic minor is
developed around a theme identified by the student, using courses from two or more
disciplines. The major advisor must approve all thematic minors. For more information
about the approval process for thematic minors contact your major advisor.</p>

<p><strong>Courses excluded from the minor</strong>: freshman composition, math courses
below Math 124, military aerospace studies, military or naval science, activity courses in
physical education, and first-year courses in foreign language and American Sign Language
that are also used to satisfy the second language requirement in general education.</p>
