<blockquote>
  <p>Integrity is expected of every student in all academic work. The guiding
  principle of academic integrity is that a student's submitted work must be the
  student's own. Students engaging in academic dishonesty diminish their
  education and bring discredit to the academic community. Students shall not
  violate the Code of Academic Integrity and shall avoid situations likely to
  compromise academic integrity. Students shall observe the provisions of the
  Code whether or not faculty members establish special rules of academic
  integrity for particular classes. Failure of faculty to prevent cheating does
  not excuse students from compliance with the Code.</p>
  <p>Conduct prohibited by the Code consists of all forms of academic
  dishonesty, including, but not limited to: cheating, fabrication, facilitating
  academic dishonesty, and plagiarism as set out and defined in the Code of
  Conduct, modifying any academic work for the purpose of obtaining additional
  credit after such work has been submitted to the supervising faculty member
  unless the supervising faculty member approves such alterations; failure to
  observe rules of academic integrity established by a faculty member for a
  particular course; and attempting to commit any act prohibited by the Code.
  Any attempt to commit an act prohibited by these rules shall be subject to
  sanctions to the same extent as completed acts. The procedures for reviewing a
  suspected violation follow:</p>
  <p><i>Faculty-Student Conference</i>. The faculty member must confer with the
  student within 15 working days of his/her being informed of a suspected
  violation.</p>
  <p><i>Appeal to Department Head.</i> The student must appeal to the Department
  Head within ten working days of notification of the imposition of sanctions
  and recommendations for suspension or expulsion. The Department Head shall
  render a decision within 15 working days.</p>
  <p><i>University Hearing Board.</i> The student must appeal to the University
  Hearing Board within ten working days of notification that the Department Head
  has upheld the sanction or that the faculty member refuses to accept the
  Department Head's recommendation that sanction(s) be rescinded. The University
  Hearing Board shall convene within 30 working days of the time the student
  files the appeal.</p>
