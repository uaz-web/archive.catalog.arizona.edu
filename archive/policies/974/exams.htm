<h3>Mid-Semester Examinations </h3>

<p>It is expected that all mid-semester examinations will occur during a regularly
scheduled class period of the course. For those multiple-section courses in which it is
impossible to offer mid-semester examinations during the regular class period, the
following requirements for offering the examination at an alternate time must be met: (1)
the course shall be identified in the schedule of classes as requiring combined hourly
examinations at a time different from the regular class period; (2) the times at which
combined hourly examinations will be given shall be listed in the schedule of classes; (3)
the controlling academic dean shall approve such action in advance; and (4) students whose
schedules conflict with the time scheduled for the combined examination shall be provided
an alternate time for taking the examination. </p>

<h3>Final Examinations </h3>

<p>All courses offered for credit shall include a final examination given at the regularly
scheduled examination time. No deviation from the exam schedule, once it is printed, is
authorized. All forms of examinations (quizzes, take-homes, etc.) are prohibited on any
scheduled class day during the week in which regularly scheduled final exams begin.
Specific exceptions for certain courses may be granted by obtaining prior approval from
the appropriate department and academic dean. Students shall be informed of any such
exceptions prior to the end of the fourth week of classes.
