<h2 align="center">The Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination </h2>

<p>Every student must take the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination, which is a
prerequisite to enrolling in a writing-emphasis course (see below). Students may take the
exam after they have satisfied the first-year composition requirement and accumulated at
least 40 but less than 75 credit hours toward their degree. Students who have accumulated
more than 75 credit hours should take the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency Examination
as soon as possible. Students register for the exam with the University Composition Board
(Modern Languages 380). Students must have taken the Upper-Division Writing-Proficiency
Examination before their application for Bachelor's Degree Candidacy will be accepted. </p>

<p>The examination may be taken only once. Results are reported to students and to their
major departments. Students who earn an evaluation of unsatisfactory on the exam usually
are required by their department to complete further work in composition before
registering for writing-emphasis courses. They should consult with their academic advisors
for specific information about their department's requirements.
