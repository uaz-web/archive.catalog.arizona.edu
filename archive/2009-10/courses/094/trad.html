The content of the course is arranged in thematic units, each unit being placed in the context of a specific historical period. We will examine the religious symbolism of ancient Chinese bronze vessels, Chinese theories of nature based on concepts like Yin and Yang, the great medieval religions of Taoism and Buddhism, and other topics. Over the semester you will learn to think more like the Chinese of centuries past to exercise your imagination, and to explore a world that is different from your own.

<B><P>Colonial Latin America</b> This course examines 1) the history of Spanish and Portuguese exploration, conquest, settlement, and state-building in the Americas; 2) the impact of European colonization on indigenous American cultures and civilizations, especially the acts of native resistance, accommodation and adaptation that shaped the consequences of this cultural encounter; 3) the forced migration of African peoples to the Americas, including the development of slave societies, and the emergence of regional African-Latin American cultural traditions; and 4) the growth of multiracial social groups who developed new and distinctive cultural forms of their own and eventually came to challenge the cultural and political hegemony of Spain and Portugal.

<B><P>Middle Eastern Humanities</b> Introduces students to the values, traditions, and development of Middle Eastern (Islamic) culture and civilization. This course is designed to familiarize students with the principal achievements in art, architecture and literature of Islamic civilization, to help students understand these achievements in their social and cultural contexts, and to consider the historical evolution of our knowledge and understanding of these achievements.

<B><P>Languages and Cultures of East Asia</b> This course will explore the social, historical, and linguistic aspects of the languages and cultures of East Asia and how they have changed over time, drawing from anthropology, linguistics, sociology, and history. 
<B><P>Confucian Asia</b> Although the countries of East Asia and many of those in Southeast Asia have very distinct cultures, languages, and national identities today, they share one important thing: all have been heavily influenced throughout their history by the world
view known as Confucianism. This course is designed to examine Confucianism in Asia through education, and the importance of ritual and propriety.
Beginning at the beginning, with the life of Confucius in the 6th century BCE and the principle text that bears his name, the Analects, we will explore the
central ideas of Confucianism and their adoption and adaptation by different Asian societies at different times. We will end with a consideration of issues in
contemporary Asia and among the Asian-American population in the U.S. that demonstrate the continued importance of this way of thought. 
<B><P>Asian Humanities: China and Japan</b> This course will expose students to major artistic, cultural, and literary movements in Japan from pre-history to the present day.

Students will discover how poetry, drama, fiction,     and film reflect Japanese aesthetics, nuances of manners and emotional expressions, and perceptions of nature. Religious diversity in Japan will be explored in art and literature, especially Shintoism, the Buddhist influences from China, and Zen Buddhism. Cultural transformations in Japan will be emphasized, such as aristocratic codes of conduct, samurai codes, rising power of chonin (non-samurai urban merchants and artisans), isolation and the West, and contemporary material culture. Particular attention will be given to class issues, gender categories, and critiques of social institutions and values.

<B><P>The Africana Experience</b> This course will introduce students to fundamental issues and
concepts in the Africana experience in the United States, Africa, and the Caribbean, from an interdisciplinary perspective. Principle topics of discussion will be drawn from areas of history, philosophy, political-economy, literature and the arts, religion-culture and society. 
<B><P>Colonialism and Native Peoples</b> Cultural studies of indigenous groups in the Americas, Eurasia, Africa and the Pacific Rim and how these have been shaped by the colonial process.

<B><P>Ancient Civilizations of the Near East</b> The purpose of this course is to examine the rich and fascinating history of the Ancient Near East. It will familiarize students with the principal social, cultural, religious, and material achievements of the  major political entities of the region. Our survey begins with the rise of the first civilization in Mesopotamia and ends with the rise of Islam. The assumptions underlying archaeological reconstruction and textual interpretation will be examined and critiqued. Contacts between traditions, mutual
 accommodations, and reciprocal influences will be discussed. The different experiences of men and women, rulers and ruled, urban dwellers, and rural and pastoral populations will also be considered. 
<B><P>Writing Systems of the World</b> Explores the nature of writing and the origin of the oldest known systems. Surveys the history and modern  decipherment of ancient writing systems, and examines the variety of systems in use in the modern world.

<DIR><B><P>Democracy in Theory and Practice: The Greek Experience</b> Investigation of the history and growth of democratic institutions, values and ideas in ancient Greece, with some reference to contemporary relevance.

<B><P>History of Western Civilization: From the Rise of Cities to the Counter Reformat</b> This course explores the civilizations of the West by considering the development of the ideas and ideologies that shaped the institutions of the West, development directed by Human interaction and conflict on a social, political, religious, and cultural level, in addition to the intellectual. Themes of particular interest include the structure and dynamics of power, competing configurations of deity and ritual, image and architecture as tools in the acquisition of authority, and the construction of a social normative on the grounds of class, culture and gender.

<B><P>Humanities: Ancient Times to Renaissance</b> Chronological survey of human civilizations from pre-history to the renaissance. Students will be introduced to the critical analysis of the literacy and artistic expressions that constitute the ideas and values of our collective heritage. Emphasis will be placed on the interrelation of Western and non-Western cultures and on the inter-perspectives including science, gender and psychology, politics, social conditions, religion and philosophy.

<B><P>In the Beginning: Roots of Western Culture</b> The roots of "western" tradition(s) are often traced to the Classical Greeks. However, by the time that work on the Parthenon had begun, the peoples of the Near East and Northeastern Africa had already witnessed the rise and fall of a series of great civilizations for over ten thousand years. In fact, many of the elements of "classical" civilization can be traced to experiments made in this distant past.

<B><P>Western Culture: The Italian Perspective: Antiquity through the Middle Ages</b> From Antiquity through the Middle Ages. Taught in English.
<B><P>World History to 1600</b> Survey of topics in world history to 1600.

<B><P>Books in Dialogue: Classical to Medieval</b> This course aims to provide solid grounding in the Western intellectual and cultural tradition through pairing of central literary, philosophical, and theological works. The second work in each pair will be studied as a response to the first: e.g., The Aeneid to The Odyssey and Aristotle's Ethics to Plato's. Students will be encouraged to deal with each of the paired texts individually and comparatively and to compare members of different pairs, e.g., Augustine with Plato, and non-scriptural works of the Christian era with the selections from the Bible.

<B><P>Drama and Dance in Western Cultures: Origins to 1603</b> Drama and dance are modes of creative expression used to communicate ideas, values, stories and myths which help define a community or culture. Both art forms employ the human body as the medium through which an audience may be engaged. Through ever-changing conventions, drama and dance reshape human experience into patterns which help us order our perceptions about the world in which we live. This course will focus primarily on principal themes in western culture as expressed in drama and dance.

<DIR><B><P>Technology and Society: Introduction to Science, Technology and Society</b> This course is an introduction to the social, historical, and ethical contexts of knowledge, science and technology. Although science and technology are perhaps the defining features of contemporary Western society, all cultures have distinct forms of knowledge and technical practices, which reflect their relationships to the natural world and other peoples. In this course we will discuss a range of questions relevant to scientists, engineers, and the general public, about the causes and contents of scientific and technical information, basing these discussions on a broad historical understanding of science and technology in various cultures.

<B><P>German Speaking World</b> This course will introduce the history and culture of the German-speaking world from the Middle Ages to the present. There will be reading about the historical events and developments that have shaped this part of Europe, and some literary and other cultural texts that reflect those developments. No knowledge of German is required, and all readings, lectures, and discussions will be in English.
<B><P>The Arts and Politics in Latin America</b> A study of the interrelationships between cultural forms and their socio-historical contexts in the development of Latin America from pre-colonial times to the present.

<B><P>Books in Dialogue: Early Modern and American</b> This course will study four pairs of works: Thomas More's Utopia and Machiavelli's The Prince; Shakespeare's Tempest and Swift's Gulliver's Travels; Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography and Thoreau's Walden; and Twain's Huckleberry Finn and Ralph Ellison's The Invisible Man. The aim will be to explore the ways in which the works respond to one another. Such exploration will entail the study of the satire, autobiography, and novel--and how the author develops his thematic interests through the manipulation of the literary forms.

<B><P>Democracy and Its Limits: The Modern Experience</b> This course examines some difficulties stemming from the theory and practice of modern democratic life, especially in the context of American democracy. The course examines such issues by a careful and intensive reading of some classic writings on democracy. In addition, attention will be paid to the historical circumstances and contemporary conditions of democracy in the United States. The aim is for the student to acquire a more well-rounded and critical perspective on the situation of democracy in modern life.

<B><P>Drama and Dance in Western Cultures: 1603 to Present</b> Drama and dance are modes of creative expression used to communicate ideas, values, stories and myths which help define a community or culture. Both art forms employ the human body as the medium through which an audience may be engaged. Through ever-changing conventions, drama and dance reshape human experience into patterns which help us order our perceptions about the world in which we live. This course will focus primarily on principal themes in western culture as expressed in drama and dance.

<B><P>Humanities: Renaissance to Present</b> Chronological survey of human civilization from the eve of the New World and African colonization, concluding with the contemporary world.

<B><P>The Making of American Cultures, 1600-1877</b> This course introduces students to the history of the United States before 1877. It focuses on the creation of a distinctive set of American cultures. Central themes include the colonial meeting of Spanish, French, English, native American, and African American cultures; the development of distinctly American Creole cultures in the eighteenth century; race and conquest; the American Revolution and the creation of a republican political culture; the transformation of that political culture through struggles over industrialization and wage labor, slavery, and women's rights; and the revolution in American political culture and social relations during the Civil War and Reconstruction.

<B><P>Russia: From Empire to Federation</b> This course is designed to familiarize students with Russia--its culture, history, politics, economy, peoples, languages, traditions, and role in the world today. Upon completion of the course students will be able to understand and discuss intelligently past and current events relating to Russia. They also will have gained a familiarity with the many perspectives available for studying a country that continues to play a significant role in world events. And beyond all this, they should have a good background for discussion of major events relating to Russia and problems in the twentieth-century world.

<B><P>The Americas - Renaissance to the Present Day</b> This course will expose students to major movements in the Americas from the Renaissance to contemporary times.

<B><P>Architecture and Society</b> The built environment has, 'a permanent and profound impact on (our) personal health, productivity and happiness, and on community life.' The purpose of this course lay the foundation of architectural literacy. The basis of this knowledge is found in understanding the relationship between a society and the forms it creates. This is accomplished through studying the major components that effect architecture: region, culture, and technology. the course follows these factors through the history of western civilization, from ancient Greece to contemporary Europe and America. Greater emphasis is given to the contemporary period because radical changes in technology and resources make this information more pertinent to the present.

<B><P>Human and Animal Interrelationships from Domestication to the Present</b> This course will examine the relationships of humans with animals throughout the ages. From evolution through domestication, the relationships of animals with humans throughout Europe and the New World will be studied.

<B><P>Classical Mythology</b> The myths, legends, and folktales of the Greeks and their origins. All readings in English. 
<B><P>Design: Culture and Language</b> This course examines design and surrounding issues, methodologies, theories of visual language and communications.

<B><P>Christianity and Art</b> The architecture, manuscript illumination, painting and other visual arts of Christianity explored within the contexts of contemporary history.
<B><P>Insects and Culture</b> Address the numerous ways in which insects (and other arthropods) interact with human culture.
<B><P>Introduction to the Africana Experience</b> Introduction to African American literature will explore the linguistic and cultural roots and traditions of literary writing by African Americans in three centuries of American history focusing on select readings in poetry, drama, and fictional prose. The overall goal of the course is to introduce students to the history of the different genres, contexts, and content of literary production by African American writers from the 1700s to the late 20th century.
<B><P>Honors Quest</b> Offered only to incoming freshmen enrolled in The Honors College, in connection with the Common Reading and First-Year Programs for Honors students. The learning outcomes for the course would be constant, but the specific content and instructor will change each year, as the choice of common reading book changes. Whatever the theme, the course will be structured on the "alternative reality game" model, integrating traditional classroom lecture with out-of-class, and online components. 
<B><P>Justice and Virtue</b> This course will introduce you to some of the central and historically important questions and ideas in moral and political thought and philosophy through the works of some of the most important thinkers in the western tradition. 
<B><P>Comparative Religions</b> A study of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, including both ancient and modern developments in their cultural contexts.

<B><P>Eroticism and Love in the Middle Ages</b> Courtly love was a discovery of the High Middle Ages and became the dominant theme in literature, the arts, philosophy, and even in religion. This course will examine the concept of love as discussed by medieval poets from the 11th through the 15th centuries and cover the wide spectrum of European history culture seen through the lenses of the theme of "love."

<B><P>Mind, Matter and God</b> Mind, Matter and God is a historical survey of the western philosophical conceptions of mind, matter and God starting with the ideas of the ancient Greeks and advancing to include primary figures in the medieval, early modern and, possibly, contemporary periods. The primary aims of the course are to acquaint students with a set of ideas that are fundamental to western culture and to foster critical thinking on abstract questions of profound intellectual and cultural importance.

<B><P>Oral and Spiritual Roots of Traditional Cultures</b> Exploration of the cultural insights in two mythological traditions: Ancient Mediterranean, origin or Western rationality and monotheistic belief; Native American, influences now being recognized.

<B><P>Science and Inquiry</b> The effects of modern science on western civilization have been profound. A moment's thought will reveal applications of science that have transformed our way of life. But aside from its practical benefits (and costs!), modern science has had an equally profound intellectual impact. An educated man or woman at the close of the twentieth century has a vastly different view of the world, and of the power of science to reveal that world, from the views of Aristotle, of Dante or even of Newton. This transformation has been brought about in large part by the development of scientific thought. In this course we shall examine the distinctive features of scientific inquiry. We shall aim to understand the power and also the limitations of scientific methods.

<B><P>Critical Cultural Concepts</b> This course examines--through literature, film, art, and philosophy-different concepts critical to the shaping of primarily "Western" culture(s), with a glance at similar concepts in "non-Western" cultures. The course is also "critical" in the sense that it asks students, through virtually weekly take-home quizzes, to critique these concepts, taking the wheat and letting the chaff be still. Topics may include the ideology of war or human rights; the problem of evil; the figure of the Trickster; and others. 

<B><P>Issues in Latin American Society and Popular Cultures</b> This interdisciplinary course will examine popular culture as an approach to understanding 19th and 20th century Latin America.

<B><P>Introduction to African American Literature</b> Introduction to African American literature will explore the linguistic and cultural roots and traditions of literary writing by African Americans in three centuries of American history focusing on select readings in poetry, drama, and fictional prose. The overall goal of the course is to introduce students to the history of the different genres, contexts, and content of literary production by African American writers from the 1700s to the late 20th century.
<B><P>Origins of Human Diversity</b> This course explores the biological and cultural evolution of the human species over the last several million years and examines human similarities and diversity globally. Approaches utilized include archaeology, biological anthropology, ecology, genetics, and geology.

<B><P>Intellectual Foundations of International Relations: Classical Theories & Modern</b> Addresses the origins and context of international relations theory in an historical context as well as referring to recent disputes.
