We examine a range of cognitive phenomena within this framework, including attention, memory, language and higher-level cognition. The class includes a lab component in which students  get hands on experience with graphical neural network software (no programming experience needed), allowing deeper, more intuitive appreciation for how these systems work.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Prerequisite(s):</b>&nbsp; INDV 101, PSY 302, PSY 325.<br><b>Typical structure:</b>&nbsp;  3 hours lecture, 3 hours laboratory.<br><b>Identical to:</b>&nbsp;   NRSC 444A,  PHIL 444A.<br><b>May be convened with:</b>&nbsp; PSY 544A.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Fall, Spring.<!--PSY 444A ends-->

 </b>&nbsp;(4 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This course introduces you to the field of computational cognitive neuroscience for understanding how the brain secretes the mind. We focus on simulations of cognitive and perceptual processes, using neural network models that bridge the gap between biology and behavior. We first consider the basic biological and computational properties of individual neurons and networks of neurons, followed by learning mechanisms that allow networks to be adaptive and to perform reasonably complex tasks. We examine a range of cognitive phenomena within this framework, including attention, memory, language and higher-level cognition. The class includes a lab component in which students  get hands on experience with graphical neural network software (no programming experience needed), allowing deeper, more intuitive appreciation for how these systems work.
 Graduate-level requirements include graduate students to work by themselves for the final project, and generate a new model from scratch to answer their question.
