<h4 align="center">Mid-Career Writing Assessment (MCWA)</h4>
<p><i> The Mid-Career Writing Assessment (MCWA) has replaced the former Upper-Division
Writing Proficiency Exam (UDWPE) as a measure of students' writing
skills.&nbsp; Students who have previously satisfied
the UDWPE requirement need take no further action.</i></p>
<p>Every undergraduate degree program requires satisfaction of the Mid-Career Writing
Assessment (MCWA).&nbsp; The MCWA is based on students' performance in their
second semester
English composition course.&nbsp; <b>A grade of A or B in one of the
following courses will satisfy this University writing proficiency requirement:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>English 102&nbsp; <b>or</b></li>
  <li>English 108&nbsp; (for ESL students)&nbsp; <b>or</b></li>
  <li>English 104H&nbsp; (for Honors students)&nbsp; <b>or</b></li>
  <li>English 109H&nbsp; (for students earning a 4 or 5 on the AP exam)</li>
</ul>
<p>Transfer courses in composition are evaluated by the <b><img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
</b> <a href="http://english.arizona.edu/writing-program">English Writing Program</a> composition
coordinators.</p>
<p>Once students have completed 40 units toward their degrees and have been
admitted to their major degree program, their academic records are
reviewed.&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">  </font><b>Students earning less than a B </b> grade in their second semester composition
course
must take one or
more additional steps to improve their composition skills so they can meet the
writing standards of their major department.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Students
are responsible for providing evidence that they have completed these additional
steps,</b> or their academic records will not reflect completion of this graduation
requirement.&nbsp; Depending on the department's
requirements, this evidence might be, for
example, an attendance sheet from a workshop series offered by the Writing
Center, writing samples revised as part of the
Writing Skills Improvement Program, or a polished portfolio of papers written for certain Tier One General Education courses.&nbsp;
Once the department has
verified that the MCWA requirement has been satisfied, the major advisor notifies
the college
dean’s office that the student has met the department’s
requirement.</p>
<p>Beginning in Spring 2003, your <a href="aprrsapr.htm">Student
Academic Progress Report (SAPR)</a> will display the Mid-Career Writing
Assessment as a degree requirement.</p>
<p><b>Procedures for students earning less than a B in their second semester
composition course:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>If you have declared a major:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;you should contact your department or college <img border="0" src="../images/globe-external.gif" alt="External Link" width="15" height="15">
    <a href="http://advising.arizona.edu/content/academic-advisor-directory">advisor</a>
    for your major for
instructions on how to satisfy the MCWA for that department.&nbsp; Your advisor
    will explain what the department expects its majors to do and will give you
    a reasonable deadline in which to accomplish it.
  <p></li>
  <li><b>If you change your major:&nbsp; </b>after meeting the MCWA
requirement for one department, be aware that you may need to take additional
    steps to satisfy the proficiency requirement for the
department of your new major.&nbsp; Contact the advisor in your new major for
    instructions on completing the MCWA for that department.<p>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you have not yet declared a major OR are in the pre-professional
    phase of your program (e.g., pre-education, pre-nursing):&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;you should&nbsp;NOT contact your department or college advisor until you
    have declared a major or are admitted to the professional phase of your
    program.&nbsp; Prior to declaring a major or while in the pre-professional
    phase, you may want to strengthen your writing skills through the Writing
    Center or Writing Skills Improvement Program so that you are better prepared
    when you are admitted to your major.<p>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you have a double major OR concurrent degree programs:</b>&nbsp; you should&nbsp;contact the department advisor of your primary major or
    primary degree program on how to fulfill the MCWA.&nbsp; While you will need
    to complete any major-specific writing requirements for both of your degree
    programs, you will satisfy the University-level writing proficiency when you
    meet the standards established by your primary major.<p>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you have previously earned a bachelor's degree from an accredited
    American institution:</b>&nbsp; your advisor for your current major will determine if you have satisfied the
    Mid-Career Writing Assessment.</li>
</ul>
