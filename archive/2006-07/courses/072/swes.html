 -- Advanced Soil and Water Chemistry
 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; Natural soils and waters are heterogeneous systems with many important reactions occurring at the interface between solid, liquid and gas phases.  The fate of chemicals that impact on terrestrial and aquatic systems is controlled largely by their behavior at these interfaces, particularly as that behavior influences chemical speciation and the relative affinity for solid and aqueous phases.  

Our objective is to understand how molecular-scale solution-phase and surface reactions influence macroscopic chemical processes such as sorption-desorption, precipitation-dissolution, oxidation-reduction and particle interactions.  The course will cover fundamentals of aqueous surface and colloid chemistry through lecture and assigned readings.  Current research in the field will be explored through independent literature research and the preparation of a term paper.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.<br><b>Prerequisite(s):</b>&nbsp; SWES 462, CHEN 103B, CHEM 480A.<br><b>Usually offered:</b>&nbsp; Spring.<!--SWES563 ends-->
