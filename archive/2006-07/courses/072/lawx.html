Because international law is part of the law of the United States law by virtue of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent, international human rights law as it concerns indigenous peoples does not just function on the international plane, but it also should be considered part of Federal Indian Law.   This course provides students with an exposure to the theory and practice of international human rights law and to how it is developing in this field.

 </b>&nbsp;(3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This course applies an historical and anthropological approach to the evidence for written (and unwritten, or 'traditional') laws in ancient societies, to uncover the rise of legal systems in culturally different communities. It explores how the imposition of non-indigenous law on other societies in Roman times gave rise subsequently to a plurality of legal systems during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, laying the foundations for universities and professionalization. 
Next, it assesses the impact of a similar imposition of written law designed for Western societies on others during the Colonial history of the last few centuries. Possible societies to study: India, Indonesia, Central and South America, and/or Native Americans. The final part of the course consists of student presentations of legal cases where applied anthropology played a significant role.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.

 </b>&nbsp;(2-3 units)<br><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; This course examines personal injury litigation against health care providers (physicians, nurses, hospitals, and HMO’s, to name a few).  Most law students are familiar with the basic concepts of personal injury litigation, at least of the “red car hits blue car” genre.  Medical liability litigation introduces many complexities, including, but in no way limited to, challenging nuances concerning  extraordinary procedural requirements, financing cases, obtaining and qualifying experts, adducing and presenting scientific evidence, the standard of care, causation, damages, joint and vicarious liability, product liability, and tort reform.  The course will be both practical and theoretical.  In addition to readings in a traditional casebook, students will study the basic steps of a medical liability case from the client interview through accepting a case, doing discovery and pretrial work, trial, and appeal.  Documents will be available if the student wishes to build a “form file” for future use.  Examination of the various stages of medical liability litigation and the textbook material will both entail consideration of underlying strategic, policy, and jurisprudential issues.  The course is good preparation for any type of relatively complex litigation.<br><b>Grading:</b>&nbsp; <a href="../../policies/grade.htm#regular">Regular grades</a> are awarded for this course: A B C D E.

Two special problems follow:   aesthetic regulation (along with its First Amendment implications), and subdivision regulation, especially as the latter is used to finance urban infrastructure.   Finally, it takes up some reforms:    the requirement that land regulators plan in advance, and that they meet regional responsibilities.
