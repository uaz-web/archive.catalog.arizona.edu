<P>
Philosophy attempts to answer analytic and speculative questions
that perplex reflective people when they examine their basic concepts,
goals, and ideals. Some of these questions arise naturally in
the course of work in the various sciences and humanities. Hence
philosophy has a natural border with all other academic disciplines,
and lends itself to joint studies and collaborations.
<P>
The Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy
degrees are available with a major in philosophy. The department
also encourages joint majors in such related fields as psychology,
political science, economics, and linguistics, among others. Specialized
minors in philosophy are available for students planning careers
in law or the health professions. For details, students should
consult the philosophy department's undergraduate advisor.
<P>
<I>The major:</I> 30 units, including 344 and at least one course
from each of the following groups: (1) history of ancient philosophy;
(2) history of modern philosophy; (3) ethics and value theory;
(4) metaphysics and epistemology; (5) logic and language. For
a complete list of courses that satisfy each of these areas, please
see the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
<P>
The major in philosophy assumes a general knowledge of mathematics.
Students can acquire this knowledge by taking MATH 122 to fulfill
the mathematics requirement. Advance work in certain specialized
areas within philosophy may require higher mathematical knowledge.
Students preparing to pursue graduate work in these areas should
consult with Undergraduate Advisor about appropriate mathematics
courses.
<P>
<I>The supporting minor</I> should be chosen after consultation
with the undergraduate advisor.
<P>
The department participates in the honors program, offering honors
sections of its introductory courses, periodic honors seminars,
and the opportunity to conduct independent honors research.
