Assistant Professor John F. Elliott
<P>
The programs of study in agricultural education prepare students
for entering careers working with people in a variety of settings.
These positions require preparation in basic sciences, technical
agriculture, knowledge of the principles and techniques of the
teaching-learning process, communication skills and the ability
to work with people.
<P>
The department offers the degree of Bachelor of Science in Agriculture
with majors in agricultural education (AED) and agricultural technology
management (AGTM). The major in agricultural education has two
options: teacher education in agriculture and non-formal education.
<P>
The department also offers programs of study leading to the degrees
of Master of Science and Master of Agricultural Education. (See
the <I>Graduate Catalog</I> for detailed information concerning
graduate programs.)
<P>
The major in agricultural education assumes moderate knowledge
of mathematics. Students must complete MATH 117 or 121.
<P>
<I>Agricultural Education: </I>
<P>
<I>Teacher Education in Agriculture </I>
<P>
One of the options in the agricultural education major, teacher
education in agriculture, prepares students for certified teaching
careers at the secondary school or the community college level.
Such teaching positions require preparation in the basic sciences,
agricultural sciences and technology, communications, and knowledge
and application of the principles and techniques of the teaching-learning
process through professional education course work.
<P>
The option in teacher education in agriculture, which leads to
teaching, includes course work which meets the requirements for
Arizona secondary school teacher certification in agricultural
education. In addition, persons who complete the program meet
the requirements for Arizona secondary school teacher certification
in general science.
<P>
Any student who plans to become a certificated teacher must be
formally admitted to teacher education in agriculture prior to
enrolling in professional education course work which includes
placement in student teaching (A ED 489). Admission requires the
completion of a formal process; including a cumulative grade point
average of 2.00 or better, participation in an interview with
faculty and completion of an application. Contact a faculty advisor
in the department for specific requirements.
<P>
<I>Degree requirements:</I> Students must complete course work
in the appropriate general education requirements in the College
of Agriculture section of the General Catalog. The option in teacher
education in agriculture requires students to complete 31 units
of the following professional education courses: A ED 338a, 401,
405, 409, 460, 461, 462, 485 and 489,. In addition, 37 units,
including the following course work in agriculture are required:
AGTM 100, 350, and 330 or 351; 5 units in plant sciences and/or
soil science; 5 units in animal sciences; 5 units in agricultural
and resource economics; and 5 units in renewable natural resources.
Teacher certification in agricultural education requires a total
of 50 semester units of agricultural course work. Contact a faculty
advisor in the department for specific Arizona teacher certification
requirements.
<P>
<I>Agricultural Education:<BR>
Non-Formal Education</I>
<P>
This option has two areas of focus, agricultural or environmental
education. Graduates with this option are prepared for a career
in agriculture where educational expertise is desired. The non-formal
agricultural education focus is similar to the teacher education
in agriculture option, except students do not complete student
teaching (A ED 489). Students complete other agricultural or related
courses in lieu of A ED 489. The non-formal environmental education
focus is designed to prepare students for a teaching career emphasizing
environmental education or for a career in an agency where environmental
educational expertise is desired.
<P>
<I>Degree requirements:</I> Students in either area of focus must
complete A ED 305, 330, 401, 405, and 439. In addition to the
previously mentioned courses, students in the non-formal environmental
education focus must complete AREC 350, A ED 402 and 422, RNR
316 or ECOL 206, RNR 384 and S W 105/106. Students in this option
complete a minimum of 18 credits in agricultural education and/or
education.

<P>
This major is designed to prepare students to become skilled in
the many aspects of agricultural technology, environmental protection,
communication, business and economics. Graduates will be prepared
for positions in small to large-scale operations where 1) an understanding
of environmental complexities, 2) an ability to communicate, and
3) technical competence are important. Employment opportunities
include: production/management/sales positions, certified plant/animal
protection specialists, and many agricultural service-oriented
positions.
<P>
Students may develop a specific option in consultation with a
faculty advisor in the department. For example, options may be
developed in plant sciences, renewable natural resources, veterinary
science, etc. Students who elect the plant science option will
have the courses necessary to qualify for California and Arizona
pest control advisor certification. Graduates planning to enter
post-graduate programs in the agricultural sciences will have
met most admission requirements.
<P>
The major in agricultural technology management assumes moderate
knowledge of mathematics. Students must complete MATH 117 or 121.
In addition, students must complete either MATH 118, 119 or 123
and 3 units of statistics.
<P>
<I>Degree requirements:</I> Students must complete course work
in the appropriate general education requirements in the College
of Agriculture section of the General Catalog. In addition, the
following courses are required: ACCT 200, 210, AREC 213, 215,
