The Department of French and Italian offers language instruction
at the elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels. In addition,
courses (taught in their respective languages) are offered in
the literature and culture of France and of Italy and in business
French and Italian. Study abroad options include programs in Florence
and in Paris. 
<P>
Undergraduate majors in French or Italian attain a knowledge of
the language and the culture that can prepare them to teach at
the secondary level, to undertake postgraduate studies in French
or Italian or to pursue careers in international business or in
the foreign service. Departmental majors selecting the latter
option may combine language study with a thematic business minor
in the College of Business and Public Administration, concentrating
in general business, management, or marketing. This option provides
a solid foundation of marketable skills for careers in international
business and finance, communications and technology, government
and administration.
<P>
<I>Degree Programs:</I> Bachelor of Arts with a major in French
(concentrations in French literature and culture, or in business
French or in teaching); Bachelor of Arts with a major in Italian
(concentrations in language and literature or in Italian studies);
Master of Arts with a major in French; and Doctor of Philosophy
with a major in French. An option at the M.A. level is the program
in Francophone studies, focusing on the cultural originality and
vitality of French-speaking areas outside of France (Quebec, Belgium,
Africa - the Maghreb, Sub-Sahara and the Caribbean). A second
option at the M.A. level is the program in language and pedagogy,
which adds a strong pedagogy component to existing language and
literature studies. Doctoral minors are offered in Italian, French
and Francophone literatures, and interdisciplinary programs are
available in conjunction with women's studies, the graduate interdisciplinary
programs in comparative cultural and literary studies, and the
program in second language acquisition and teaching.
<P>
<I>Writing-Emphasis Courses:</I> Because writing in all upper-division
courses is in the language of instruction (French, Italian or
English), the requirement will be satisfied through completion
of at least one 3-unit course designated as a Writing-Emphasis
Course within the department (see &quot;Writing-Emphasis Courses&quot;
in the <I>Academic Guidelines</I> section of this catalog). Consult
an undergraduate advisor.
<P>
The department participates in the honors program and offers honors
sections of selected courses. Inquire with the departmental honors
advisor.

201-202 and completion of courses for one of the following options.

<I>Language and literature option:</I> 305a-305b (or 305c) and
400a-400b.Italian studies option: 300a-300b and 6 additional units
of Italian course offerings. All upper-division courses count
toward either option available within the major or minor; however,
students selecting the language and literature option are expected
to do their coursework (reading and writing) in Italian. For this
purpose, courses taught in English have bilingual texts for the
literature com-ponent. Students selecting the Italian studies
option may complete all upper-division courses in English. Courses
taught in Italian, however, apply to either option as do courses
taught in the Arizona Program in Italy. There are no prerequisites
for upper-division courses taught in English, which may be taken
in conjunction with ITAL 201-202
