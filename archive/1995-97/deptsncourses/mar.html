The department provides instructional programs designed to prepare
students to assume leadership roles in the media arts as independent
artists or as members of industries such as film, television and
cable television. Course work focuses upon history, theory, criticism,
production and management of the media arts. The department offers
courses leading to the Bachelor of Arts with a major in media
arts and Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with a major in media arts.
Advanced students have opportunities to obtain preprofessional
experience through the department's internship program, and through
work on various departmental projects.
<P>
The department strongly recommends that students develop basic
typing and computer word processing skills prior to taking courses
in media arts.
<P>
The department participates in the honors program.
<P>
The department participates in career specializations through
the interdisciplinary studies major, which is described elsewhere
in this catalog. Information on these areas of study is available
from the Media Arts Office, Modern Languages Building, room 265.
<P>
<I>The Bachelor of Arts with a major in media arts</I> is designed
for students planning careers in media management or for those
students seeking a well-balanced liberal arts education in critical
studies of the media as preparation for graduate study at the
M.A. or Ph.D. level.
<P>
<I>Requirements:</I> In addition to the general education requirements
for the Bachelor of Arts with a major in media arts, as described
in the Fine Arts <I>(Arts and Sciences)</I> section of this catalog,
students must complete COMM 100 and 102 and one of the following
English composition courses beyond the freshman requirement: ENGL
207, 307, or 308. Requirements in the major: a minimum of 35 units
of media arts courses, including media arts core (200, 201a, 201b,
202, 210), and 18 units of media arts upper-division course. Of
the 18 units of required upper-division courses, 6 units must
be from the approved media arts &quot;Critical Studies&quot; list
and 6 units from the approved media arts &quot;Industry and Management&quot;
list. A listing of approved &quot;Critical Studies&quot; and &quot;Industry

upper-division media arts writing proficiency course also is required.

degree. At least 18 units in the major must be University Credit.
<P>
<I>The Bachelor of Fine Arts </I>prepares students for creative
leadership roles in media production, primarily in video, film
and computer visualization. This program also provides an appropriate
basis for advanced study at the M.F.A. level.
<P>
The B.F.A with a major in media arts is limited to an enrollment
of 25 students per year, with students entering the course rotation
only in the fall. Admission to this program will be selective
and competitive due to limited faculty and laboratory resources.
All students who have met criteria for advanced standing in media
arts may apply but only the most qualified applicants will be
admitted. Specific instructions regarding B.F.A admission criteria
(portfolio review, statement of purpose, GPA) and application
procedures are available from the departmental office.
<P>
<I>Requirements:</I> The general education requirements for the
Bachelor of Fine Arts are identical with those of the B.A. with
a major in media arts, as described above. <I>Requirements in
the major:</I> a minimum of 60 units of media arts courses, including
the media arts core (200, 201a, 201b, 202, 210), plus 297a, as

stock, processing and other necessary supplies.
<P>

whose courses of study might require mathematics courses beyond
the minimum requirement (e.g. business minors; anyone needing
statisitics; production students with a focus on computer imaging;
etc.) should select the &quot;M&quot; (moderate knowledge) mathematics
strand. Students in the &quot;M&quot; strand should take MATH
117 or higher (but not MATH 122) to satisfy the general education
math requirement. Students who are certain that their course of
study will not require mathematics beyond the minimum requirement
should select the &quot;G&quot; strand (general knowlege) strand
and take MATH 122.
<P>

comprise a minor in media arts: 200, 201a, 201b, 202 and 210,
