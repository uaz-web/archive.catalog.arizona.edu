The School of Music, a division of Fine Arts, offers course work
leading to the following degrees: Bachelor of Music with majors
in jazz studies, music education, performance, and composition;
Bachelor of Arts in Music; Master of Music; Doctor of Musical
Arts; and Doctor of Philosophy. The school of Music participates
with the Committee on Dance in providing course work for the drama-musical
theatre major offered by the Department of Theatre Arts for the
Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. The school is a member of the National
Association of Schools of Music, and the requirements for entrance
and graduation as set forth in this catalog are in accordance

<P>
<I>Entrance Requirements:</I> Entrance examinations in musicianship
and the major performance area are required. All freshmen and
transfer music majors (except piano and organ performance majors)
must audition for placement in class or group piano instruction.
These courses should be taken concurrently with MUS 120a-120b
and 220a-220b. Students desiring the B.A. in Music or the B.M.
with a major other than performance must meet the requirements
for registration in MUSI 181 in their major performance area.
B.M. students majoring in performance must meet the requirements
for registration in MUSI 185 in their major performance area.
Admission to the 181 level requires minimum performance skill
equivalent to at least two years of recent private study and/or

Admission to the MUSI 185 level requires a minimum of five years
of private study or ensemble/solo experience resulting in sufficient
advancement that the student shows promise of being at a professional
level after completion of four years of undergraduate study. MUSI
180 serves as a remedial course of study for the student who does
not qualify for MUSI 181, but who possesses good basic playing
skills and music comprehension. Enrollment is contingent upon
audition and availability. Detailed information regarding entrance
and degree requirements is available from the Director of the
School of Music.

<P>
<I>Special Regulations:</I> Credit for private or group instruction

attend master classes and recitals as arranged by the instructor.
Students may, at the discretion of their major adviser or performance
instructor, be required to register for MUS 201/401 or 202/402
and to appear in and attend performances as arranged by their
instructor. Lessons missed by the student will not be rescheduled
unless the instructor has been notified by the student 24 hours
