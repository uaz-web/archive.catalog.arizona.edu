with majors in management information systems and operations management.
Interested students should follow the program of studies in the
<I>College of Business and Public Administration </I>section of
the catalog. 
<P>
<I>Management information systems:</I> Education in management
information systems enables students to establish careers involving
the analysis, design, implementation, use and management of computerized
information systems in an organizational environment. Course work
is available at the graduate and undergraduate levels.
