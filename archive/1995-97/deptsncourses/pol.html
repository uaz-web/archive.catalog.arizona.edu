The Department of Political Science offers courses on the philosophies,
processes, organizations, methods, and policies of government
and related political institutions. These courses focus on government
and politics in the United States and foreign countries and also
on how governments of different nations relate to one another.
Political science instruction is useful for pursuing careers in
government, politics, law, business, education, journalism, and
the media.
<P>
The department offers the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master
of Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy with a major in political science.
A Bachelor of Arts in Education and a Master of Education with
a teaching major in political science are also available. For
information on graduate degrees, please see the <I>Graduate Catalog</I>.
<P>
<I>The major</I>: Thirty units of course work in political science
must be taken, including 102 and at least one of the following:
100, 120, 140, 160. At least 18 units of this course work must
be upper-division courses (300- and 400-level courses). Individual
study cannot be used to satisfy this 18-unit requirement. Students
must also take courses from five of the six fields of study listed
below. The major in political science assumes general knowledge
of mathematics. Students may satisfy this requirement with MATH
122; the department also will accept MATH 117 or 121 or higher.
<P>
<I>The minor</I>: Twenty units of course work must be taken. At
least nine units in the minor must be upper division.
<P>
<I>The teaching minor</I>: Twenty units of course work in political
science must be taken. Of the total twenty units, twelve must
be taken in one of the six subfields. In addition, one of the
lower-division courses - 100, 102, 120, 130, or 160 - must be
within the appropriate subfield.
<P>
<I>Teacher certification</I>: The U.S. and Arizona Constitutions
requirement for a teacher's certificate may be satisfied by two
course options: 102, 230; 102, 214. An additional option is the
constitutions examination, which carries no university credit.
<P>
<I>Fields of study</I>: The department is divided into six substantive
areas or fields of study. These fields of study, with appropriate
course listings, are as follows: (1) American Political Institutions:
205, 214, 230, 231, 309, 406, 407, 412; (2) Political Behavior:
330, 332, 334, 335, 340, 355, 431, 432, 434, 435, 436, 487; (3)
Law and Public Policy: 206, 350, 388, 470, 471, 473, 474, 476,
480, 481, 483, 485; (4) Political Theory: 290, 321,322, 323, 326,
427, 428; (5) Comparative Politics: 240, 242, 244, 247, 270, 437,
440, 441, 443, 444, 445, 447, 448, 449, 450, 468; and (6) International
Relations: 250, 360, 451, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 461, 464.
<P>
<I>Special programs</I>: Majors interested in law, civil service,
or foreign service should consult the department's career advisors
regarding an appropriate course of study. Internships are offered
in connection with the State Legislature, the Public Defender,
the Juvenile Court, administrative agencies of the City of Tucson
and Pima County, and the U.S. Congress. Three credits of internship
can be counted toward the minimum thirty units for the major.
It does not fulfill the upper-division or sub-field requirements
for the major. Prelaw students interested in legal problems of
American Indians may combine prelaw and American Indian policy
courses in the Department of Political Science with the minor
in American Indian studies.
<P>
The department participates in the honors program.
