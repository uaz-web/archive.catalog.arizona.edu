<B><A NAME="general"></A>Admission Requirements</B> 
<P>
The University of Arizona welcomes applications for admission
from all individuals who qualify. Students with a record of success
or high motivation to succeed will find the rich blend of academic
and social opportunities for learning particularly well suited
to their needs.
<P>
The University strives to create a campus environment which understands,
fosters, and embraces the value of diversity among students, faculty
and staff. Diversity encompasses differences in age, color, ethnicity,
gender, national origin, disability or handicap, race, religion,
sexual orientation or Vietnam era veteran status. This institution
is committed to the belief that all persons are valued for their
individual characteristics, talents and contributions.
<P>
The Office of Admissions and New Student Enrollment offers numerous
opportunities for visiting the University including campus tours,
personal interviews, and meetings with faculty members. Prospective
students should call the Office of Admissions and New Student
Enrollment at (520) 621-3641 for information about campus visitation
programs, to arrange for personal appointments and for student-conducted
campus tours.

<P>
<B>Residency Classification</B> 
<P>
In Arizona, as in all other states, instruction fees at publicly
supported universities are lower for residents than for nonresidents.
Through the payment of taxes, Arizona residents contribute to
the general fund of the state from which the legislature appropriates
funds comprising the major source of support for Arizona's universities.
<P>
A student enrolling at The University of Arizona for the first
time, or a student returning after an absence of one or more semesters,
must provide information which will allow classification as either
a resident or nonresident of Arizona for tuition purposes. For
new students, this information is requested on the application
for admission; for returning students, a domicile affidavit is
provided with the application for readmission. Because international
students (non-immigrants) are classified nonresidents of Arizona
while enrolled, a domicile affidavit is not required.
<P>
<B>Health Verification Requirements</B> 
<P>
All students born after December 31, 1956, must submit proof of
vaccination for measles and rubella since 1980 before they will
be allowed to register for classes. Additionally, it is recommended
that recent (within six months) results of a TB test be submitted.
If the skin test is positive, a chest x-ray is recommended. Medical
or nursing students should defer the chest x-ray until arrival
at the University.
<P>
Health service requirements are subject to change. Affected students
will be notified when appropriate.<A NAME="nondegree"></A>

Arizona Board of Regents yet not be accepted for admission.
<P>
<B>General Aptitude</B> 
<P>
The University has two types of admission for freshman and transfer
students: unconditional and conditional. Conditional admission
requires a student to participate in some form of academic assistance
program such as Fall Transition, special advising and freshman
support groups, tutoring and study skills workshops, reduced course
load, and new student orientation programs. A limited number of
students may be referred to community college programs of study
in anticipation of future enrollment.

is required to be considered for admission as a transfer student.
However, actual admission will be based upon the overall qualifications
of the nonresident applicant pool.
<P>
All students transferring with less than 36 transferable semester
units will be subject to the same requirements as regular admittees
from high schools and must show evidence of having fulfilled the
required high school subject units. Such units must be completed
in the same manner as designated for entering freshmen.
<P>
<I>Note: The above statements do not necessarily apply to students
seeking admission to divisions of the University which may have
higher entrance requirements. See the sections stating requirements
for admission to the colleges of architecture, business and public
administration, education, engineering and mines, and pharmacy.</I>

<P>
<B>Transfer of Credits</B> 
<P>
The University of Arizona evaluates applicants from regionally
accredited postsecondary institutions or postsecondary institutions
which are <I>candidates for accreditation based upon the individual
merits of their academic achievements. </I>Credit is not given
for grades lower than a C. Grades from other institutions are
not included in the calculation of The University of Arizona grade-point
average. Remedial, vocational, technical, highly specialized and
personal development courses are not accepted for credit. Applicability
of transfer credit to a student's academic curriculum is determined
by the academic advisor in the student's major department.
<P>
Inquiries concerning transfer credit from foreign institutions
should be directed to the Office of Admissions and New Student
Enrollment, Foreign Credentials.
<P>
<B>Credits from Community Colleges</B> 
<P>
While there is no limit to the total number of units of course
work acceptable for transfer credit that may be transferred from
an accredited community college to The University of Arizona,
no more than 72 of those units may be applied toward the requirements
for a bachelor's degree. The choice of the 72 units is at the
discretion of the student in consultation with an advisor. Transfer
students are encouraged to complete freshman and sophomore level
general education course work at their community colleges. Transferability
of courses of independent study, internship, or practicum will
be determined by the appropriate department or college at The
University of Arizona and may be restricted both in number of
units and in degree applicability. Students who have taken community
college courses in these categories may petition for an exception.
<P>
While all courses offered for transfer will be accepted by the
University according to these rules, the specific lower-division
requirements of various curricula vary widely. In order to complete
the baccalaureate program in the normal time span, the student
should consult the appropriate <I>Colleges</I> section of this
catalog and the head of the appropriate University department
to determine requirements of a particular program.
<P>
Normally, a community college course whose content is offered
at The University of Arizona in the upper division (carrying a
course number of 300 or higher) will not be accepted as the equivalent
of The University of Arizona upper-division course.
<P>
<B>The Transfer General Education Core Curriculum (TGECC)</B>

<P>
The Arizona public community colleges and The University of Arizona
have agreed upon a common structure for a general education core
curriculum. This common agreement is called the Transfer General
Education Core Curriculum (TGECC). The TGECC is composed of a
minimum of 41 semester units of lower-division general education
course work in which a student may prepare for transfer. Students
transferring from an Arizona community college to the University
have the option of completing the lower-division general education
requirements at the University or completing the TGECC. Completing
the TGECC will fulfill lower-division general education requirements
at the University. Students utilizing this option will still be
required to fulfill lower-division program requirements and prerequisites
within their college and major/minor area of study. In order to
complete a degree program efficiently, students should select
courses to meet the TGECC requirements that will also fulfill
program requirements in the college and major they intend to pursue
upon transfer. The requirements for the TGECC are available through
the Arizona community college advising center.
<P>
<B>The Community College Transfer Guide</B> 
<P>
The community college <I>Transfer Guide</I> presents the lower-division
requirements of bachelor's degree programs at The University of
Arizona in terms of the transferable courses available at Arizona
community colleges, numbered in the community college notation.
The <I>Transfer Guide</I> should be used in conjunction with <I>The
University of Arizona General Catalog</I> and the <I>Arizona Higher
Education Course Equivalency Guide. </I>Students should refer
to the community college catalogs for descriptions of the courses
listed in the <I>Transfer Guides.</I> 
<P>
Transferability of community college courses not listed in the
<I>Transfer Guide or the Course Equivalency </I>Guide must be
approved by The University of Arizona academic unit which offers
the degree being sought. Courses accepted for transfer in this
way may be restricted both in number of units transferable and
the manner in which they may be used to satisfy degree requirements.
<P>
While all courses offered for transfer will be accepted by the
University subject to the above rules, the specific lower-<BR>
division requirements of various curricula vary widely. In order
to complete the baccalaureate program in a timely manner, the
student should consult the section of the <I>Transfer Guide </I>that
is appropriate for the student's curriculum.<A NAME="foreign"></A>

<P>
<B>ADMISSION OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS</B> 
<P>
Students with non-immigrant visas should request application materials
for undergraduate admission from the Office of Admissions and
New Student Enroll-ment, Foreign Credentials, Robert L. Nugent
Building. A $35.00 application fee is required. This payment must
be in the form of a check or money order drawn on a U.S. banking
affiliate, and made pay-able in U.S. dollars to The University
of Arizona. The University does not accept International Postal
Money Orders. International students are expected to have above-average
grades, proficiency in the English language, and adequate financial
resources for each year of attendance. International students
are not required to take the American College Test (ACT) or the
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) unless they are graduating from
a U.S. high school. The results of national exams must be submitted
directly from the examining board.
<P>
All applicants whose native language is not English are required
to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), which
is given at test centers worldwide under the direction of the
Educational Testing Service. A minimum composite TOEFL score of
500 is required for full-time admission. For test information,
write: TOEFL Publications, Box 6154, Princeton, New Jersey 08541-6154.
Results of the TOEFL are valid for two years. Applicants should
request that TOEFL (Box 6153, Princeton, New Jersey 08541-6153)
send their scores to The University of Arizona (UA code number
4832). The scores must be received before the application for
admission can be considered. Newly admitted international students
may also be required to take a math and English placement test
and further study in English if necessary. Transfer students from
U.S. colleges or universities must check with their academic advisor
and/or the University Composition Board to determine their upper-division
writing proficiency requirements.
<P>
For those lacking college-level English proficiency, the University's
Center for English as a Second Language (CESL) offers full-time
English language training. The full semester sessions carry no
college credit, but satisfactory completion of CESL study (which
includes taking the TOEFL examination) will meet the English proficiency
requirement for admission. Request further information by writing
to CESL, Room 100, Building 24. For students seeking academic
admission a statement of academic admissibility should be requested
from the Office of Admissions and New Student Enrollment, Foreign
Credentials, before applying to CESL. Admission to CESL does not
guarantee admission to any full-time credit program at The University
of Arizona.
<P>
Other non-immigrants may arrange to take the International TOEFL
on The University of Arizona campus and should contact the Testing
Office, located in Old Main, Room 223, for registration information.
<P>
Non-immigrants must submit proof of financial resources to support
themselves while in residence at The University of Arizona. If
sponsorship is through an organization or government agency, the
Office of Admissions and New Student Enrollment, Foreign Credentials,
should be notified directly by the sponsor of the terms of scholarship
support. These must include instructions if The University of
Arizona is to bill for tuition and fees. The address for billing
must be through an embassy or other agent in the United States;
otherwise, the students must pay their own fees at registration.
<P>
Having provided the first year's expenses and having earned superior
grades during at least one year of study at the University, international
students may be considered for one of the very few, highly competitive
international student tuition waivers. The United States Immigration
Department restricts employment for pay of anyone in this country
on a student visa, and non-immigrants should not expect to supplement
their income through employment.
<P>
There are three mandatory health requirements for all international
students and scholars.
<P>
1) All international students are required by University regulations
to have current health insurance. All non-sponsored students and
scholars are required to purchase The University of Arizona's
supplemental health insurance. Sponsor insurance must be approved
by the Student Health Service. If the student is on a J-1 visa,
all accompanying family members must also be enrolled in the University's
supplemental health insurance plan. (Contact the Student Health
Service Insurance Office for application forms.)
<P>
2) All international students must participate in a tuberculosis
screening program. The tuberculosis screening test <I>must</I>
be conducted by the University Student Health Service before class
registration. Proof of screening by any other organization is
not acceptable.
<P>
3) All students born after December 31, 1956, must provide documentation
of adequate measles <I>and </I>rubella immunity before registering
for classes at The University of Arizona. Documentation must show
proof of vaccination for measles <I>and </I>rubella since 1980.
<P>
Information about insurance, TB screening and immunization requirements
will be forwarded to all international students upon admission
to the University.
<P>
<B>Application Deadlines</B> 
<P>
<I>April 1 is the deadline for summer and fall and September 15
is the deadline for spring. </I>To meet the deadlines, the application
and all other credentials and statements must be received in the
Office of Admissions and New Student Enrollment, Foreign Credentials,
by the above dates.
<P>
<B>ADMISSION OF STUDENTS WHOSE NATIVE LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH</B>

<P>
Applicants whose native language is not English are required to
take the <BR>
Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), which is given
at test centers worldwide under the direction of the Educational
Testing Service. A minimum composite TOEFL score of 500 is required
for admission to an academic program. For test registration information,
write: Test of English as a Foreign Language, Box 6154, Princeton,
New Jersey 08541-6154.
<P>
In Tucson, arrangements may be made to take the Institutional
TOEFL at The University of Arizona by contacting the Center for
English as a Second Language, Room 100, Building 24. To take the
International TOEFL, contact the Testing Office located in Old
Main, Room 223.<A NAME="disabled"></A>

and referral assistance.
<P>
<B>Exemption of Certain Veterans from Effects of Failing Grades</B>

<P>
According to Arizona statute, failing grades in college courses
received at Arizona post-secondary institutions prior to military
service may not be used to deny admission to a U.S. veteran who
has served for at least two years and was honorably discharged.
This policy applies to the admission decision only. Failing grades
awarded at The University of Arizona remain on the record. The
student admitted or readmitted to the University under this statute
is subject to all academic regulations and standards in this catalog.
<P>
<B>Credit for U.S. Military Service</B> 
<P>
<I>A Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the
Armed Services</I>, published by the American Council on Education,
has been adopted by The University of Arizona as a basis for evaluating
armed forces training.
<P>
Credit for military service experiences may be acquired through
standardized examinations (see credit by examination policy).
Cases which fall outside of the regular policies of the University
will be reviewed by the registrar. Military credit evaluation
is completed only after a student has been admitted to the University
and all required documentation has been submitted (normally, the
form DD-214).
<P>
For active service terminated under honorable conditions in the
armed forces, credit is given as follows: for a period of <I>at
least six months</I> and less than a year, the University allows
4 units of military science; for one year or more of active service,
8 units of military science; for the rank of warrant officer,
6 upper-division units of military science, naval science, or
aerospace studies; and for a commission at the rank of second
lieutenant or higher (in the Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps),
or the rank of ensign in the Navy, 12 upper-division units in
military science, naval science, or aerospace studies. For more
information, contact the Office of Admis-sions and New Student
Enrollment.
<P>
<B>Programs of Study</B> 
<P>
All veterans receiving benefits must choose a program of study
and may take only courses that fulfill degree requirements. Veterans
and their dependents are not allowed to enroll in course repeats,
course audits, or independent study courses without the approval
of the Center for Veterans and Off-Campus Students.
<P>
<B>Attendance</B> 
<P>
Veterans and their dependents are compensated for attending classes
and completing course work. Benefits will be reduced if the Center
for Veterans and Off-Campus Students finds that either is not
occurring.
<P>
<B>Change in Status</B> 
<P>
Any time academic progress or other status of a veteran is changed,
a notice will be sent to the Veterans' Administration Regional
Office, within 30 days following the occurrence, or last day of
class attendance. It is the veteran's responsibility to notify
the Center for Veterans and Off-Campus Students of any status
changes.
<P>
<B>Veterans' Deferment of Tuition Payments</B> 
<P>
Veterans' tuition deferments are available to many veterans and
eligible dependent students. All deferments must be approved by
the veterans' coordinator.<A NAME="readmission"></A> 
<P>
<B>READMISSION TO THE UNIVERSITY</B> 
<P>
<B>Applying for Readmission</B> 
<P>
1. Students absent from the University for a semester or longer

<P>
<B>Readmission Requirements</B> 
<P>
1. Students seeking readmission who were not on academic probation

<P>
<B>RESIDENCY (DOMICILE) CLASSIFICATION FOR TUITION PURPOSES</B>

<P>
In Arizona, as in all other states, instruction fees at publicly
supported universities are lower for resident students than for
nonresident students. Through the payment of taxes, Arizona residents
contribute to the general fund of the state from which the legislature
appropriates funds comprising the major source of support for
Arizona's universities.
<P>
The rules used in classifying resident status assure that only
bona fide residents are assessed the resident fee. The rules allow
only domiciled persons to be classified as residents for tuition
fee purposes.
<P>
In determining a student's residency, The University of Arizona
follows the laws of the State of Arizona and the policies of the
Arizona Board of Regents. The Board of Regents is required by
law to establish for the universities under its jurisdiction and
control uniform guidelines and criteria for the classification
of students for payment of tuition. Attention is invited to relevant
provisions of the constitution, statutes, and laws of Arizona,
including Sections 3 and 6, Article 7 of the Constitution (which
provisions have been held by the Supreme Court of Arizona to govern
domicile for all purposes), Sections 15-1625, 15-1626, and 15-1801
through 15-1807 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, as amended.
<P>
A. A person who does not qualify to enroll as an in-state student
must pay a nonresident tuition, <I>in addition to other established
fees and charges that are required for all students</I>. An out-of-state
student must pay an out-of-state tuition fee each semester in
addition to a registration fee.
<P>
B. The general rule is that in order to obtain in-state status
for tuition purposes, a student must establish his/her domicile
in Arizona at least one year immediately prior to the last day
of registration for the semester in which the student proposes
to attend the University. Arizona domicile occurs when a person
is physically present in Arizona with the intention of making
Arizona his or her permanent home provided that the student can
prove financial independence for the last two years.
<P>
There are certain exceptions to the general rule. A student may
also be eligible for in-state status if he or she can establish
that, on or before the last day of registration, he or she meets
one of the following criteria:
<P>
1. <I>Dependent. </I>The student and his or her parent are domiciled
in Arizona but have not met the one year durational requirement,
and the parent is entitled to claim the student as a dependent
for federal and state tax purposes.
<P>
2. <I>Transferred Employee.</I> The student is domiciled in Arizona,
but has not met the one year durational requirement, and is an
employee or spouse of an employee transferred to Arizona by his
or her employer for employment purposes.
<P>
3. <I>Military. </I>The student is not domiciled in Arizona, but
is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces stationed in Arizona pursuant
to military orders or is a member's spouse or dependent child
as defined in A.R.S. section 43-1001.
<P>
4. <I>Native American. </I>The student is not domiciled in Arizona,
but is a member of a Native American tribe whose reservation land
lies partially in Arizona and another state and is a resident
of such reservation.
<P>
C. Mere presence of a person in the State of Arizona for one year
does not necessarily establish a domicile for classifying that
person as an in-state resident. All evidence is weighed under
the presumption that a non-resident student's presence in Arizona
is primarily for educational purposes and that decisions of an
individual to establish domicile are generally made after completion
of an education and not before. No person shall be deemed to have
gained or lost a domicile by reason of his or her presence or
absence while a student at any institution of learning.
<P>
D. The person must have his or her domicile determined prior to
registration and payment of fees. The responsibility of registration
under proper status is placed upon the individual. Prompt filing
of the required domiciliary information will enable the University
to determine classification prior to registration. The Board of
Regents has promulgated a publication entitled: <I>Summary of
Tuition Classification Policies,</I> which is incorporated by
reference in this catalog, and the attention of all persons concerned
with classification for tuition purposes is directed to this publication
available in the office of the residency classification officer
in Room 210, Administration Building. (These materials include:
(a) definitions related to domicile; (b) guidelines, rules, and
regulations applied to determine domicile; and (c) information
on procedures for appeal.)
<P>
An affidavit or petition must be completed and filed prior to
any decision concerning domicile. The affidavit is required upon
original registration or after an absence of one or more semesters.
A student desiring a change in classification must complete and
file an Application to Change Domicile Classi-fication with all
supporting documentation necessary to provide a basis for in-state
classification.
<P>
In all cases where the records indicate that the student's domicile
is not in Arizona, out-of-state tuition will be assessed. Any
student found to have made a false or misleading statement concerning
his or her domicile shall be subject to dismissal from the University.
<P>
E. Classification officers of the University shall be designated
to determine domicile. If there is any question as to domicile,
the matter should be brought to the attention of the classification
officers and passed upon prior to registration and payment of
fees. The same classification officers can, during the registration
period published by the University or at other times, pass upon
the domicile of a person.
<P>
F. The President of the University shall appoint one or more appeals
committees to hear the cases of individuals who believe that the
decision regarding their domicile is not consistent with the laws
of the State of Arizona or the summary promulgated by the Arizona
Board of Regents. An appeal shall be filed in the office of the
residency classification officer. It shall be written, signed
by the student, and accompanied by a sworn written statement of
all facts relative to the matter. Notice of appeal shall be filed
at any time within 35 days from the last day of registration published
by the University. The person appealing shall have the right to
appear and testify before the committee and to be represented
by an advisor.
